This uninterrupted development is due to many research projects and practices that are being carried out to improve the quality of services and applications supported by networking technologies. Initially, the plethora of computer networks research was designed to allow users to share the thoughts and facts using textual data through addressing devices. Meanwhile, we have witnessed that users play the role of both producers and consumers at the same time. These new emerging requirements gave birth to Cloud Computing (CC), Data Centric Networking (DCN), and other advancements in IEEE standards. Moreover, researchers also intended to redesign the networking architectures and protocols with the focus on content rather than the host. The resulting new architectures are Information Centric Networks (ICN) with various extensions like Content Centric Networks (CCN), Named Data Networks (NDN), Data-Oriented Network Architecture, etc.",

Spam over Internet Telephony (SPIT) is a type of attack which is a significant detriment to the user’s experience. A number of techniques have been produced to detect SPIT calls. We reviewed these techniques and have proposed a new approach for quick, efficient and highly accurate detection of SPIT calls using neural networks and novel call parameters. The performance of this system was compared to other state-of-art machine learning algorithms on a real-world dataset, which has been published online and is publicly available. The results of the study demonstrated that new parameters may help improve the effectiveness and accuracy of applied machine learning algorithms. The study explored the entire process of designing a SPIT detection algorithm, including data collection and processing, defining suitable parameters, and final evaluation of machine learning models.",

To solve the consensus problem under the input saturations, the consensus trajectory should be bounded such that the control inputs of all agents are not saturated. However, generating a bounded trajectory satisfying this condition is not an easy problem. Accordingly, we construct the modified reference generator to generate the bounded trajectory for any bounded initial states, and two types of distributed controllers depending on the available information are proposed to track the generated trajectory. Specifically, we construct the distributed controllers using the state feedback and the output feedback based on the output regulation approach, respectively. Then, utilizing the low gain method, we show the existence of the solution for the semi-global output consensus problem. Finally, we provide numerical examples to demonstrate the theoretical results.",

        "abstract": "We have developed a Probabilistic Multi-Topic Model that segments large-scale online clients, such as those on e-commerce platforms or social media, into distinct aesthetic quality communities based on their shared preferences for dress colors. This method leverages a geometry-based feature selection strategy to effectively capture and model each client’s aesthetic tendencies, characterized by a diverse set of features, including those learned under weak supervision. These features are further refined through a feature selection process. The model represents each client’s color preferences as a probabilistic multi-topic distribution within a hidden feature space, offering a comprehensive understanding of their aesthetic inclinations. To uncover the underlying connections between clients with similar preferences, we construct a graph-based framework and employ a specialized algorithm to identify tightly connected subgroups, or aesthetic quality communities. These communities are defined by shared dress color preferences, such as an affinity for bold, vibrant hues or subtle, neutral tones. To enhance personalization, the model integrates a ranking mechanism that recommends dress colors and styles aligned with the identified communities. By learning from these aesthetic quality communities, the system ensures that recommendations are both relevant and deeply resonant with the client’s unique aesthetic profile. We validated the effectiveness of this approach using a dataset comprising over one million clients. Results demonstrate that our model accurately identifies and classifies distinct aesthetic quality communities, enabling internet-scale personalized dress color recommendations that are aesthetically aligned and client-centric.",

        "abstract": "Smartphones and tablets are finding their way into healthcare delivery to the extent that mobile health (mHealth) has become an identifiable field within eHealth. In prior work, a mobile app to document chronic wounds and wound care, specifically pressure ulcers (bedsores) was developed for Android smartphones and tablets. One feature of the mobile app allowed users to take images of the wound using the smartphone or tablet’s integrated camera. In a user trial with nurses at a personal care home, this feature emerged as a key benefit of the mobile app. This paper developed image analysis algorithms that facilitate noncontact measurements of irregularly shaped images (e.g., wounds), where the image is taken with a sole smartphone or tablet camera. The image analysis relies on the sensors integrated in the smartphone or tablet with no auxiliary or add-on instrumentation on the device. Three approaches to image analysis were developed and evaluated: 1) computing depth using autofocus data; 2) a custom sensor fusion of inertial sensors and feature tracking in a video stream; and 3) a custom pinch/zoom approach. The pinch/zoom approach demonstrated the strongest potential and thus developed into a fully functional prototype complete with a measurement mechanism. While image analysis is a very well developed field, this paper contributes to image analysis applications and implementation in mHealth, specifically for wound care.",

Abundant content information is available to provide a different view for community detection process. In this paper, we propose an overlapping community detection method, namely, latent Dirichlet allocation-based link partition (LBLP), which uses a graphical model and considers network structure and content information. Two feature integration strategies are proposed to combine the influence of network structure and content information on the network generation process. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world networks show that the LBLP method is effective, and content information is beneficial in mining community structure.",

Although CS for medical images has been extensively investigated, a challenge remains in the reconstruction time of the CS. This paper considers a reconstruction of CS using sparsity averaging (SA)-based basis pursuit (BP) for RGB color space of eye image, referred to as RGB-BPSA. Next, an enhanced RGB-BPSA (E-RGB-BPSA) is proposed to reduce the reconstruction time of RGB-BPSA using a simple SA generated by the combination of Daubechies-1 and Daubechies-8 wavelet filters. In addition, variable density sampling is proposed for the measurement of E-RGB-BPSA. The performance metrics are investigated in terms of structural similarity (SSIM) index, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and CPU time. The simulation results show the superior E-RGB-BPSA over the existing RGB-BPSA at an image with a resolution 512×512 pixels into a measurement rate 10% with SSIM of 0.9, SNR of 20 dB, and CPU time of 20 seconds. The E-RGB-BPSA can be a solution to massive data transmissions and storage for the future of medical imaging.",

Furthermore, the control scheme adopts a class of dual RBF NNs, in which the network weights can be updated online to approximate the nonlinear system functions and the upper bound of estimated disturbances, respectively, improving the system stability and robustness. Meanwhile, the adaptive control laws obtained by Lyapunov analysis can guarantee the system a stable operation. Finally, by comparing with the integer-order control strategy, the simulation results verify that this proposed controller has a better performance in the suppression of the harmonic, elimination of system uncertainties, and the reduction of current tracking error.",

        "abstract": "Data center networks (DCNs) for 5G are expected to support a large number of different bandwidth-hungry applications with exploding data, such as real-time search and data analysis. As a result, significant challenges are imposed to identify the cause of link congestion between any pair of switch ports that may severely damage the overall network performance. Generally, it is expected that the granularity of the flow monitoring to diagnose network congestion in 5G DCNs needs to be down to the flow level on a physical port of a switch in real time with high-estimation accuracy, low-computational complexity, and good scalability. In this paper, motivated by a comprehensive study of a real DCN trace, we propose two sketch-based algorithms, calledα-conservative update (CU) and P(d)-CU, based on the existing CU approach.α-CU adds no extra implementation cost to the traditional CU, but successfully trades off the achieved error with time complexity. P(d)-CU fully considers the amount of skew for different types of network services to aggregate traffic statistics of each type of network traffic at an individual, horizontally partitioned sketch. We also introduce a way to produce the real-time moving average of the reported results. By theoretical analysis and sufficient experimental results on a real DCN trace, we extensively evaluate the proposed and existing algorithms on their error performance, recall, space cost, and time complexity.",

        "abstract": "In the field of autonomous driving, the technology of 3D object detection using LiDAR point clouds has been widely implemented. However, existing detectors are faced with challenges due to redundant overhead when processing large amounts of background points in the depth perception field, and insufficient feature mapping in the central regions of large objects. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel 3D object detection model, SDPSNet, which combines spatial dynamic pruning and self-attention feature diffusion to reduce data redundancy and improve the representation of central features. SDPSNet introduces a spatial dynamic pruning sparse convolution strategy to optimise the inference efficiency and data redundancy of the detector. Meanwhile, the self-attention feature diffusion module is used to effectively diffuse the features of the object edges to the central region, providing a richer and more accurate representation for modelling the centre of large objects. Extensive experimental results have been conducted on the Waymo Open, nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets. On Argoverse2, SDPSNet achieves a 2.8% increase in mAP over the previous hybrid detector, HEDNet, while being2.4×faster. It outperforms the previously popular sparse detector FSDv2 by 2.3% in mAP and is1.5×faster. It also shows a 0.2% improvement in mAP and is1.2×faster than the current best-performing sparse detector, SAFDNet.",

Recently, cross domain CF is a new way to alleviate this difficulty. In this paper, we propose a user-based cross domain CF algorithm based on a linear decomposition model. We pour the items together and learn a linear decomposition model to explore the relationship between the total similarity and the local similarities of different domains. We first construct training samples by computing the similarities of any two users in different domains. Then, we solve a linear least square problem to obtain the decomposition coefficients. Finally, we compute the local similarity in the target domain using the decomposition model. Since we compute the similarity in the target domain with the help of rich ratings in other domains, this similarity would be expected to be more accurate than the measured similarity computed by the sparse ratings in the target domain. We conduct extensive experiments to show that the proposed algorithm is effective in addressing the data sparsity problem, as compared with many state-of-the-art CF methods.",

        "abstract": "Pervasive computing and Internet of Things (IoTs) paradigms have created a huge potential for new business. To fully realize this potential, there is a need for a common way to abstract the heterogeneity of devices so that their functionality can be represented as a virtual computing platform. To this end, we present novel semantic level interoperability architecture for pervasive computing and IoTs. There are two main principles in the proposed architecture. First, information and capabilities of devices are represented with semantic web knowledge representation technologies and interaction with devices and the physical world is achieved by accessing and modifying their virtual representations. Second, global IoT is divided into numerous local smart spaces managed by a semantic information broker (SIB) that provides a means to monitor and update the virtual representation of the physical world. An integral part of the architecture is a resolution infrastructure that provides a means to resolve the network address of a SIB either using a physical object identifier as a pointer to information or by searching SIBs matching a specification represented with SPARQL. We present several reference implementations and applications that we have developed to evaluate the architecture in practice. The evaluation also includes performance studies that, together with the applications, demonstrate the suitability of the architecture to real-life IoT scenarios. In addition, to validate that the proposed architecture conforms to the common IoT-A architecture reference model (ARM), we map the central components of the architecture to the IoT-ARM.",

        "abstract": "We present monolithically integrated waveguide with thin isolated layers of dielectric material, which ensure efficient emission of guided light in multiple optical windows. The proposed waveguide is fabricated by using silicon oxynitride (SiON) which functions as the core guiding layer, and silicon nitride (SiN) which facilitates effective vertical emission of guided light via optical windows. The theoretical operating principle is analyzed by Finite-Difference-Time-Domain (FDTD) simulation, and the experimentally fabricated device is demonstrated to find the expected operational trend by measuring vertical emission of light through the optical windows. We further find that the physical origin of such efficient emission stems from the Fabry-Perot resonance induced laterally at the interface between the optical windows and cladding layers, which leads to the strong emission of light at the edge of optical windows. The output efficiencies of light emission from SiN optical windows, which are fabricated in cascaded fashion on top of the SiON waveguide, are 30, 45 and 55 percent at the wavelength of 457, 532, and 637 nm, respectively. The proposed design concept can be applied to various potential applications including optical integrated circuits with vertical interconnection, optical emission in wearable devices for virtual and augmented reality, and other emerging optical sensors.",

In particular, the proposed design has an asymmetric configuration of the limb planes with redundant joints and the symmetric arrangement of the limb rotation centers, capable of compensating parasitic motion and enabling continuous rotation around a fixed axis. To better describe the kinematics of the parallel motion system with the additional redundant joints, we derived an analytical model for the inverse kinematics instead of employing the numerical methods (such as the Denavit-Hartenberg method), which also helped to evaluate the workspace by considering physical joint constraints. The prototype system was fabricated and the experimental test platform was established, where comprehensive experiments demonstrated that the proposed design achieved the nanopositioning performance without parasitic motion, with a spatial motion resolution of1.87μrad×1.99μrad×4.39nm. The results also indicated great potential of the proposed mechanism for nanorobotic positioning and manipulating, with excellent cross-scale motion capability and effective mitigation of parasitic motions.",

Unlike the conventional method of performing full-step analysis (FSA) over one period of electrical angle, the MSA accurately derives the average torque and fundamental voltage results by utilizing only two steps. To validate the performance of the MSA, the analysis accuracy and reduction in analysis time for torque-beta, voltage-beta, and torque-speed curves are compared between the MSA, FSA, and quasi-3D FEA which is another analysis time reduction method across the four cases of pole-slot combinations of yokeless and segmented armature (YASA) type AFPMM. The MSA confirms its overwhelming performance compared to quasi-3D FEA, and compared to FSA, it achieved a maximum error rate of 0.26% for torque-beta, 0.32% for voltage-beta, and 0.30% for torque-speed, along with a 94% reduction in analysis time. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the analysis method is validated through the experimental results of a 20pole-18slot YASA type AFPMM. The proposed analysis method is expected to be widely utilized by motor designers and engineers in the initial design and characteristic curve derivation stages, as it can be universally applied to complex geometries and radial flux permanent magnet motors.",

It has many applications such as biometric authentication, video surveillance, and others. In the past decade, several methods for face recognition were proposed. However, these methods suffer from pose and illumination variations. In order to address these problems, this paper proposes a novel methodology to recognize the face images. Since image gradients are invariant to illumination and pose variations, the proposed approach uses gradient orientation to handle these effects. The Schur decomposition is used for matrix decomposition and then Schurvalues and Schurvectors are extracted for subspace projection. We call this subspace projection of face features as Schurfaces, which is numerically stable and have the ability of handling defective matrices. The Hausdorff distance is used with the nearest neighbor classifier to measure the similarity between different faces. Experiments are conducted with Yale face database and ORL face database. The results show that the proposed approach is highly discriminant and achieves a promising accuracy for face recognition than the state-of-the-art approaches.",

System log-analysis tools assist system designers gain understanding into a large volume of system logs. They enable system designers to perform various analyses (e.g., diagnosing node failures or predicting node failures). Current system log-analysis tools vary significantly in their function and design. We conduct a systematic review of literature on system log-analysis tools and select 46 representative articles out of 3,758 initial articles. To the best of our knowledge, there is no work that studied the characteristics of log-correlation tools (LogCTs) with respect to four quality attributes including (a) spurious correlations, (b) correlation threshold settings, (c) outliers in the data and (d) missing data. In this paper, we (a) propose a quality model to evaluate LogCTs and (b) use this quality model to evaluate and recommend current LogCTs. Through our review, we (a) identify papers on LogCTs, (b) build a quality model consisting of the four quality attributes and (c) discuss several open challenges for future research.

        "abstract": "Chameleon authentication tree (CAT) is an important authenticated data structure for verifiable data streaming in 5G networks. But the typical CAT cannot support the dynamic scenario very well because it cannot expend freely since its height is fixed. Therefore, we proposed a dynamic CAT (DCAT) with the feature of adaptive expansion. We divided the algorithms of the DCAT with the following phases: setup, append, query, and verification. The DCAT removes the drawbacks of the static CAT. In the setup phase, it is not required for the scale of the tree to be determined, and the scale of the tree can be adaptively expanded during the data-appending phase. Therefore, the DCAT can suit the data stream environment better. During the data querying phase, the average authentication path length has been reduced, which leads to less space requirement and better verification efficiency. Finally, we performed theoretical analysis and drew a comparison between the static CAT and the DCAT in terms of performance. The result indicates that the DCAT provides improvements in the performance of the data-appending, data-querying, and data verification processes.",

        "abstract": "Multi-modal representation learning has become a pivotal area in artificial intelligence, enabling the integration of diverse modalities such as vision, text, and audio to solve complex problems. However, existing approaches predominantly focus on bimodal interactions, such as image-text pairs, which limits their ability to fully exploit the richness of multi-modal data. Furthermore, the integration of modalities in equal-scale environments remains underexplored due to the challenges of constructing large-scale, balanced datasets. In this study, we propose Synergy-CLIP, a novel framework that extends the contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) architecture to enhance multi-modal representation learning by integrating visual, textual, and audio modalities. Unlike existing methods that focus on adapting individual modalities to vanilla-CLIP, Synergy-CLIP aligns and captures latent information across three modalities equally. To address the high cost of constructing large-scale multi-modal datasets, we introduce VGG-sound+, a triple-modal dataset designed to provide equal-scale representation of visual, textual, and audio data. Synergy-CLIP is validated on various downstream tasks, including zero-shot classification, where it outperforms existing baselines. Additionally, we introduce a missing modality reconstruction task, demonstrating Synergy-CLIP’s ability to extract synergy among modalities in realistic application scenarios. These contributions provide a robust foundation for advancing multi-modal representation learning and exploring new research directions.

        "abstract": "Over the last few decades, there has been considerable concern over the multifactory manufacturing environments owing to globalization. Numerous studies have indicated that flexible job-shop scheduling problems (FJSPs) and the distributed and FJSPs (DFJSPs) belong to NP-hard puzzle. The allocation of jobs to appropriate factories or flexible manufacturing units is an essential task in multifactory optimization scheduling, which involves the consideration of equipment performance, technology, capacity, and utilization level for each factory or manufacturing unit. Several variables and constraints should be considered in the encoding problem of DFJSPs when using genetic algorithms (GAs). In particular, it has been reported in the literature that the traditional GA encoding method may generate infeasible solutions or illegal solutions; thus, a specially designed evolution process is required. However, in such a process, the diversity of chromosomes is lost. To overcome this drawback, this paper proposes a refined encoding operator that integrates probability concepts into a real-parameter encoding method. In addition, the length of chromosomes can be substantially reduced using the proposed algorithm, thereby, saving computation space. The proposed refined GA algorithm was evaluated with satisfactory results through two-stage validation; in the first stage, a classical DFJSP was adopted to show the effectiveness of the algorithm, and in the second stage, the algorithm was used to solve a real-world case. The real-world case involved the use of historical data with 100 and 200 sets of work orders of a fastener manufacturer in Taiwan. The results were satisfactory and indicated that the proposed refined GA algorithm could effectively overcome the conflicts caused by GA encoding algorithms.",

To construct a cooperative tracking control scheme, the proposed distributed controller is designed according to adjacent trains’ state information, including position, velocity, and acceleration. Radial basis function neural networks are introduced to tackle uncertain operational resistance, and the weight values of the neural network are updated online. Actuator failures with partial loss of effectiveness are estimated and compensated using adaptive methods. Another neuro-adaptive fault-tolerant control law is proposed to further solve the actuator saturation problem. The developed tracking controller remains fault-tolerant even under saturation limits while ensuring the stability of the closed-loop system. It is demonstrated using Lyapunov stability analysis that uniform ultimate boundedness is guaranteed for all signals of the closed-loop system. Numerical simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.",

This type of link can consist of single nodes with a large number of antennas or a large number of cooperating nodes—each contributing a small number of antennas. Such massive systems naturally lead to link topologies that are not often considered in studies of smaller scale cooperative MIMO scenarios. For this system to be economically practical, each node participating in the massive link likely has limited transmit power capability, and therefore properly limiting the per-node transmit power must be incorporated into the signal processing algorithm. This paper develops a generalized multiuser massive MIMO (G4M) optimization algorithm for colocated or cooperative signaling, subject to any sum-, per-antenna, or per-node power constraint, and that can also accommodate nonlinear precoding and detection and any number of antennas. Using the G4M algorithm, a number of topologies unique to cooperative massive MIMO are described, demonstrating the facility this algorithm provides in optimizing the performance of multiuser massive links with atypical topologies.",

Second, we empirically show that PSG acting as a regularizer to the weight vectors is favorable for model compression domains such as quantization, pruning, and knowledge distillation. PSG reduces the gap between the weight distributions of a full-precision model and its compressed counterpart. This enables the versatile deployment of a model either as an uncompressed mode or as a compressed mode depending on the availability of resources. The experimental results on CIFAR-10/100 and ImageNet datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed PSG in model compression including an iterative pruning method and the knowledge distillation.",

Additionally, it maps these use cases to the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to assess their alignment with global sustainability policies. A systematic literature review following the PRISMA framework was conducted across four databases (Scopus, Web of Science, Engineering Village, and PubMed), identifying 81 peer-reviewed studies. DT use cases were categorized into sustainability dimensions and qualitatively mapped to UN SDGs. We identify 28 unique DT use cases supporting HS sustainability – 13 contributing to economic (e.g., precision medicine, early diagnosis), 8 to environmental (e.g., energy-efficient hospital operations, waste management), and 7 to social sustainability (e.g., provider burnout prevention, equitable access). Our mapping reveals that DTs could support 11 of 17 UN SDGs, including SDG 3 (good health and well-being), SDG 8 (economic growth), SDG 9 (innovation), and SDGs 12–15 (environmental impact mitigation), among others. This study documents the significant potential of DTs to enhance HS sustainability across economic, environmental, and social dimensions while supporting multiple SDGs. However, most existing DT studies overlook explicit sustainability linkages, with limited attention to assessing or prioritizing DTs’ impact on HS sustainability. Future research should develop standardized sustainability metrics, conduct empirical studies, and create frameworks linking DT outcomes to SDGs.",

        "abstract": "Compared to traditional heterogeneous graph (HG) data, Bi-typed Multi-relational Heterogeneous Graph (BMHG) not only have various edge relationships between different types of nodes but also connections among the same type of nodes, which increases modeling complexity. However, existing Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNN) primarily focus on HGs with single relationships and are ineffective for BMHGs. These methods often rely on meta-paths to capture node features, which leads to the loss of intermediate node information. To address this, this paper proposes a Semantic Fusion-based Bi-typed Multi-relational Heterogeneous Graph model (SF-BMHG), aimed at solving the challenges of multiple edge relationships and complex semantic information processing among nodes in BMHGs. SF-BMHG first generates new features with intermediate nodes through a feature fusion strategy to avoid the loss of intermediate node information. It then captures semantic information in BMHGs using the new node features and meta-relation paths, integrating features from different semantic paths with a semantic-level attention mechanism. Additionally, it employs relational convolutions to capture relationship features within different types and fuses different relationship features through a relational-level attention mechanism. Ultimately, SF-BMHG combines intra-type relationship features and inter-type semantic features to produce rich feature embeddings. Experimental results on real-world constructed datasets demonstrate that, compared to existing baseline methods, SF-BMHG achieves superior performance across various tasks.",

        "abstract": "Modern displays have the capability of rendering video contents encoded with high dynamic range (HDR) standards. HDR contents deliver more realistic visual experiences by wider color gamut and luminance compared to standard dynamic range (SDR) contents. However, most of the available contents are encoded with SDR standards. To provide HDR contents, the technology converts existing SDR contents to HDR contents, what we call SDRTV-to-HDRTV, is highly demanded by providers such as IPTV or broadcasting services. In this paper, we divide SDRTV-to-HDRTV conversion problem into global and local mapping problems. Transformers recently achieve significant performance and are known for conducting global mapping effectively. Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) are specialized for extracting and converting local features. In this regard, we introduce a combined model with a transformer for global mapping and CNN for local mapping, which solves the SDRTD-to-HDRTV problem in a complementary manner. We intensively explore the best combination strategy for transformers and CNNs. Through comprehensive objective/subjective experiments, we verified that the proposed method achieves the highest performance compared to the existing models in both fidelity and visual quality perspectives. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to utilize Vision Transformer for the SDRTV-to-HDRTV conversion problem. To boost the performance, we combined Vision Transformer with architectural strategies which are previously applied on convolutional neural networks such as residual connection, dense connection, and squeeze-and-excitation module. We introduce a new Vision Transformer architecture denoted as DenSE-SwinHDR. Our method outperforms in terms of objective scores and visual quality compared to the state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, DenSE-SwinHDR achieved 0.79 dB PSNR, 0.93 dB PU-PSNR gain over HDRTVNet. Also, our proposed method achieve best performance on subjective quality assessment.",

        "abstract": "The massive number of the machine type communication terminals accessing the satellite network brings a new challenge for the random access (RA) system. To meet the challenge, by using the polarization transmission structure in the satellite uplink, we propose a new RA scheme dubbed polarized multiple input multiple output slotted ALOHA (PMSA). In PMSA, in one slot, one packet and two overlapped packets can be decoded successfully with the polarized MIMO detection algorithms, and some of three overlapped packets may be decoded successfully in consideration of the capture effect at the satellite node. For the new features of the proposed scheme in physical layer, the protocol of medium access control (MAC) is modified based on the slotted ALOHA (SA). Simulation results show that the normalized throughput of the PMSA can reach 0.84 and is consistent with the theoretical throughput. Moreover, it is also shown that the throughput of PMSA is about 2.3 times as large as that of the SA and 1.5 times as large as that of the contention resolution diversity slotted ALOHA (CRDSA), without the need for additional transmitted power and time slots to transmit the replicas of the packets. The received packets in the proposed PMSA are processed slot by slot, not as that processed frame by frame in the CRDSA with a large additional frame delay.",

Deepfakes may now produce natural-looking content, making them harder to identify. Much progress has been achieved in identifying video deepfakes in recent years; nevertheless, most investigations in detecting audio deepfakes have employed the ASVSpoof or AVSpoof dataset and various machine learning, deep learning, and deep learning algorithms. This research uses machine and deep learning-based approaches to identify deepfake audio. Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) technique is used to acquire the most useful information from the audio. We choose the Fake-or-Real dataset, which is the most recent benchmark dataset. The dataset was created with a text-to-speech model and is divided into four sub-datasets: for-rece, for-2-sec, for-norm and for-original. These datasets are classified into sub-datasets mentioned above according to audio length and bit rate. The experimental results show that the support vector machine (SVM) outperformed the other machine learning (ML) models in terms of accuracy on for-rece and for-2-sec datasets, while the gradient boosting model performed very well using for-norm dataset. The VGG-16 model produced highly encouraging results when applied to the for-original dataset. The VGG-16 model outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches.",

        "abstract": "This research critically examines the relationship between game user experience satisfaction and continuance intention, focusing on dividing game user experience satisfaction into design and psychological factors and examining their mediating roles. Data were collected from 524 players of League of Legends and League of Legends: Wild Rift via online surveys. Using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) and Multi-Group Analysis (PLS-MGA), the study examines factors such as usability/playability, narratives, play engrossment, enjoyment, creative freedom, audio aesthetics, personal gratification, social connectivity, visual aesthetics, and continuance intention. The findings demonstrate that desktop version players are more likely to have higher educational attainment and more extended gaming experience than mobile version players, with a partial mediating relationship between game user experience satisfaction and continuance intention. A significant observation is the differences between casual and core players in user experience satisfaction. In contrast, audio aesthetics have a more pronounced effect on enjoyment for casual players. Additionally, for core players, visual aesthetics have a more substantial impact on continuance intention, mediated by enjoyment, compared to casual players. However, no significant differences were observed across hypothesized paths based on gaming platforms. These insights underscore the importance of game user experience satisfaction in the mediating influence on players’ continuance intention. Key design elements, such as enhancing audio and visual aesthetics, are identified as practical strategies to improve player engagement and loyalty, providing valuable insights for developers optimizing gaming experiences across platforms.",

        "abstract": "This paper studies the semantics of models for discrete physical phenomena, such as rigid body collisions and switching in electronic circuits. This paper combines generalized functions (specifically the Dirac delta function), superdense time, modal models, and constructive semantics to get a rich, flexible, efficient, and rigorous approach to modeling such systems. It shows that many physical scenarios that have been problematic for modeling techniques manifest as nonconstructive models, and that constructive versions of some of the models properly reflect uncertainty in the behavior of the physical systems that plausibly arise from the principles of the underlying physics. This paper argues that these modeling difficulties are not reasonably solved by more detailed continuous models of the underlying physical phenomena. Such more detailed models simply shift the uncertainty to other aspects of the model. Since such detailed models come with a high computational cost, there is little justification in using them unless the goal of modeling is specifically to understand these more detailed physical processes. All models in this paper are implemented in the Ptolemy II modeling and simulation environment and made available online.",

Microseismic (MS) source location is of great importance and forms the foundation of the MS monitoring technology used in tunnel rockburst hazard mechanism analysis. A highly accurate method for locating MS events that occur during rockburst development in tunnels is proposed here. An anisotropic velocity model, rockburst event monitor, and a global optimization algorithm (particle swarm optimization) are used in tandem to make the proposed method feasible and the location accuracy better. Simulation results show the MS sources can be located more accurately using the proposed method. The average location error is reduced by 20.16 m. Our method was used to locate MS events associated with rockburst development processes occurring in the deep tunnels of the Jinping II hydropower station in China. The location accuracy of the MS events in the rockburst development process is significantly improved. The case study shows that the located MS events are clustered together more closely in the rockburst area. The average distance of all the MS events to the position of the rockburst is reduced from 23.77 to 13.43 m. The method is highly conducive to in-depth analysis of rockburst development processes and investigation of their mechanisms of formation.",

        "abstract": "Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) issued Secure Zero Touch Provisioning (SZTP) as a provisioning technique for networking devices without human intervention. SZTP standardizes the provisioning workflow from device enrollment to bootstrapping process. Unfortunately, implementing a single trust model of public key infrastructure scheme in zero-touch device provisioning is vulnerable to impersonation attacks using bogus certificates. This paper proposes a robust protocol for the bootstrapping process of edge devices by integrating the Attack Resilient Public Key Infrastructure (ARPKI) scheme with SZTP. As a transparent and accountable public key infrastructure, ARPKI can prevent the miss-issuance of a certificate. ARPKI offers strong security as certificate management for SZTP. We adopt the security properties of ARPKI to construct an accountable bootstrapping scheme of a zero-touch provisioned edge device against threats, e.g., impersonation, incurred by insiders compromised by adversaries. The edge device and bootstrap server can confidently build mutual authentication using the TLS 1.3 full handshake protocol together with the ARPKI-based certificates built upon a trusted public certificate log, which provides the accountability of the certificate. We analyze our scheme’s security properties by performing formal and informal analyses. We show that the combination of ARPKI and SZTP can detect malicious entities and mitigate misbehaving activities. Our provisioning scheme provides accountable bootstrapping for edge devices in a zero-touch fashion with integrity and confidentiality of bootstrapping data.",

Then, by using matrix theory, graph theory, Lyapunov stability theory, and some decoupling methods, sufficient conditions for the sampled-data L2- L∞consensus of the closed-loop system are derived under fixed and switching topologies, respectively. The desired gains can be obtained by solving a set of linear matrix inequalities. Finally, two numerical examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed DOF control protocol.",

These episodes are common in sleep-deprived individuals and can lead to catastrophic outcomes.

The study aims to develop a lightweight version of the model to reduce computational costs and provide faster detection, enabling quicker intervention to prevent accidents in safety-critical environments. We propose a customized deep learning model, Hyper-Opt-ANN, designed to detect microsleep episodes from EEG signals. The model is evaluated across five time windows (1 second, 2 seconds, 3 seconds, 4 seconds, and 5 seconds), with the 4 seconds window showing the best performance. The Hyper-Opt-ANN model achieved a significant accuracy of 97.33%, demonstrating its efficacy and potential for accurate microsleep detection using EEG signals. This method significantly outperforms traditional approaches and has potential applications in safety-critical domains.

        "abstract": "As the largest target in remote sensing images, buildings have important application value in urban planning and old city reconstruction. However, most networks have poor recognition ability on high resolution images, resulting in blurred boundaries in the segmented building maps. Then, the similarity between buildings and backgrounds will lead to inter-class indistinction. Finally, the diversity of buildings brings difficulties to segmentation, which requires the network to have better generalization ability. To address these problems, we propose Fusion Multi-scale Attention Mechanism Network (FMAM-Net). Firstly, we design Feature Refine Compensation Module(FRCM) to improve the boundary ambiguity problem, including Feature Refinement Module(FRM) and Feature Compensation Module(FCM). FRM utilizes the densely connected architecture to refine features and increase recognition capabilities. FCM introduces low-level features to make up for the lack of boundary information in high-level features. Secondly, to handle inter-class indistinction, we design Tandem Attention Module(TAM) and Parallel Attention Module(PAM). TAM is designed to sequentially filter some features from channels and spaces for adaptive feature refinement. PAM combines context information and uses high-level features to guide low-level features to select more distinguishable features. Finally, based on the binary cross entropy loss function, we add an evaluation index to reduce the error caused by determining the optimization direction only through cross entropy. On the Inria Aerial Image Labeling Dataset, FMAM-Net achieves mean IoU of 85.34%, which is 5.58% higher than AMUNet and 3.77% higher than our baseline(U-Net ResNet-34). On the WHU Dataset, IoU reached the maximum value of 91.06% on FMAM-Net, 1.67% higher than SARB-UNet and 0.2% higher than MAP-Net. The visualization results show that FMAM-Net improves the fuzzy boundary of building segmentation and reduces the inter-class indistinction.",

In response, our research brings together multiple devices, including smartphones, bicycles, and in-vehicle systems, under a single user preference model to propose a novel proactive caching framework that surpasses traditional single-device approaches that give each device a unique set of preferences. Exploiting the advantages of both Device-to-Device (D2D) and Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communications, our proposed approach minimizes core network congestion and increases spectrum efficiency.

Our proposed CFCA improves caching efficiency by clustering users based on shared zones of interest and behavioral data, achieving a 27% improvement in network offloading and a 24% increase in cache hit ratio over existing benchmarks. Furthermore, the study explores the economic implications of proactive caching, establishing a strategic balance that ensures long-term profitability while minimizing high-cost caching inefficiencies.

The software architecture of the proposed new sailboat platform is also simplified as it involves only Python programming for the Raspberry Pi 4.

        "abstract": "During the past few years, we are witnessing the emergence of 5G and its high-level performance targets. Waveform (WF) design is one of the important aspects for 5G that received considerable attention from the research community in recent years. To find an alternative to the classical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), several multicarrier approaches addressing different 5G technical challenges, have been proposed. In this paper, we focus on critical machine-type communications (C-MTC), which is one of the key features of the foreseen 5G system. We provide a comparative performance study of the most promising multicarrier WFs. We consider several C-MTC key performance indicators: out-of-band radiations, spectral efficiency, end-to-end physical layer latency, robustness to time and frequency synchronization errors, power fluctuation, and transceiver complexity. The investigated multicarrier WFs are classified into three groups based on their ability to keep the orthogonality: in the complex domain, e.g., most of the OFDM-inspired WFs, in the real domain like offset-quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM)-based techniques, and non-orthogonal WFs like generalized frequency division multiplexing and filter bank-based multicarrier-QAM. Finally, the performances of these WFs are thoroughly discussed in order to highlight their pros and cons and permit a better understanding of their capabilities in the context of C-MTC.",

        "abstract": "As the Internet of Things (IoT) becomes increasingly indispensable across various domains, the connectivity between humans, machines, and devices intensifies. With the surge in IoT devices deployed in numerous fields, security risks have escalated, particularly the proliferation of botnets. Due to IoT devices’ limited resources and performance, they are easily exploited by malware to form part of IoT botnets. Numerous studies have attempted to detect IoT botnets using artificial intelligence, yielding promising results. However, challenges such as poor interpretability, high false positive rates, and difficulty in adapting to new and evolving threats persist. This paper presents a systematic literature review of IoT botnet detection research conducted over the past five years, initially filtering 143 studies and ultimately reviewing 134 based on a quality assessment. It examines the IoT botnet lifecycle, which describes the formation of a botnet, and evaluates various detection methods, with a focus on the types of features extracted for detection and how they relate to different phases of the botnet lifecycle. Additionally, an IoT botnet malicious activity map is presented to address the challenges faced by current detection models. This study also highlights key limitations and future research directions, offering valuable insights to improve the performance of IoT botnet detection systems.",

        "abstract": "The use of Low Power Wide Area (LPWA) networks in the 920-MHz band, which are compatible with terrestrial network devices, is being explored for a satellite Internet-of-Things (IoT) system. In this system, terminals cannot use the channels the terrestrial networks use to avoid contention with them. Thus, terminals are limited to different channels depending on their location, resulting in throughput degradation. This study proposes an adaptive transmission control scheme to mitigate throughput degradation caused by different available channels for the Contention Resolution Diversity Slotted ALOHA (CRDSA)/Irregular Repetition Slotted ALOHA (IRSA). The proposed scheme reduces the estimation error of transmitting load at the base station, updates the transmission probability at the terminal to maximize the throughput by considering the characteristics of CRDSA/IRSA, and introduces smoothing of the transmission probability. This proposed scheme enables adaptive transmission control without the base station knowing the terminals’ available channels. We evaluated the proposed transmission control through simulation and clarified that it can achieve high throughput by preventing the influence of the available channel difference.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a mathematical model for worm propagation, where infectivity is influenced by latency within heterogeneous Internet of Things (IoT) systems. The model incorporates the heterogeneity of susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered (SEIR) compartments and considers the varying negative impacts of worms spread across these groups. Sufficient conditions for the persistence of worm propagation are derived using the optimistic equilibrium point. By selecting latency as a bifurcation parameter, the study reveals a specific latency value critical for maintaining worm propagation’s stability in these systems. The normal form approach and central manifold theory are employed to analyze the direction and stability of Hopf bifurcation. Furthermore, this study addresses strategies for mitigating the spread of worms by employing best practices to minimize the number of devices exposed and infected across systems. We analyze the effects of control measures, such as vaccination and treatment, which should be applied promptly during a worm proliferation outbreak and gradually scaled down over time as the outbreak decreases. Numerical findings expose that latency significantly impacts system stability, however, optimally managing the latency below a deterministic threshold may maintain system stabilization.",

For urban traffic planning in smart cities, one of the biggest challenges is traffic congestion prediction and its avoidance. Traffic congestion is a complex phenomenon and it is a manifestation of various contributing factors. In addition to vehicular mobility, properties of road network, weather, holidays and peak hours play a significant role in traffic congestion especially on arterial roads within a city. In this paper, we proposed a hybrid GRU-LSTM based deep learning model and applied it on city-wide novel traffic data integrated from heterogeneous sources. We have devised our indigenous data pipeline that is composed of a set of algorithms dealing with map matching, sparsity handling, outlier removal, zero speed adjustments, Open Street Map (OSM) and segment mapping etc. Extensive experimentations have been carried out to demonstrate the improved performance of the proposed method. The comparative analysis reveals that our methodology yields 95 % accuracy that outperforms other deep neural network models.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce a novel but intuitive scheme to recover multiple signals of interest (SoI) from multiple emitters in signal collection applications such as signal intelligence, electronic intelligence, and communications intelligence. We consider a case where the SoIs form a heavy interference environment. The scheme, which is referred to as reference-based successive interference cancellation (RSIC), involves a combination of strategic receiver placement and signal processing techniques. The scheme works by placing a network of cooperative receivers where each receiver catches its own SoI (despite multiple interferences). The first receiver demodulates the initial SoI (called a reference signal) and forwards it to the second receiver. The second receiver collects a received signal containing the second SoI but is interfered with by the initial SoI, which is a problem called co-channel interference in cellular communications. Unfortunately, the amplitude scaling of the interference is unknown in the second receiver and therefore has to be estimated via least squares error. It turns out that the estimation requires a priori knowledge of the second SoI, which is the very signal it tries to demodulate, thereby yielding a Catch-22 problem. We propose using an initial guess on the second SoI to form an amplitude estimate such that the interference is subtracted (cancelled) from the collected measurement at the second receiver. The procedure is applied to a third receiver (or multiple receivers) until the last of the desired SoI is separated from all of the co-channel interferences. The RSIC scheme performs well. Using quaternary phase shift keying as example modulation, we present major symbol error rate (SER) performance improvements with the use of RSIC over the highly degraded SER of receivers that are heavily interfered and do not employ any cancellation technique.",

In particular, special emphasis is placed on decode-and-forward relay systems, equipped with bulk and per-subcarrier selection schemes, respectively. The exact expressions for outage probability are derived in integrals for general cases. In addition, asymptotic expressions for outage probability in the high signal-to-noise ratio region in the finite circle relay distribution region are determined in closed forms for both relay selection schemes. In addition, the outage probabilities for free space in the infinite relay distribution region are derived in closed forms. Meanwhile, a series of important properties related to cooperative systems in random networks are investigated, including diversity, outage probability ratio of two selection schemes, and optimization of the number of subcarriers in terms of system throughput. All analyses are numerically verified by simulations. Finally, a framework for analyzing the outage performance of the OFDM systems with spatially random relays is constructed, which can be easily modified to analyze other similar cases with different forwarding protocols, location distributions, and/or channel conditions.",

        "abstract": "With the steadily growing penetration of renewable energy, considerable uncertainties and intermittency are introduced to the power grid. On the other hand, controllable load plays an increasingly important role in the system power balance. Therefore, load regulation strategy is more critical than before to the reliability and safety of power system. A framework of comprehensive load regulation strategy with consideration of outage risk is proposed in this work to deal with power tight balance and power deficiency. Firstly, the orderly electricity consumption (OEC) and demand response (DR) based on time of use (TOU) pricing program are collaboratively employed. Then, orderly consumption power (OCP) is determined by power balance analyzing and flexible resource accessing, reasonably allocated over the subsystems by considering the load types and energy efficiencies, and further specified by components of peak shifting, peak averting and power rationing. Secondly, load-shedding risk evaluation algorithm based on multiple samplings with short-term chronological sequences (MSSCS) is proposed to accurately evaluate load-shedding risk without prohibitive computational burdens. Furthermore, the clear pictures of outage risks over OCP are depicted by calculating incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. Comprehensive case studies are implemented and confirm the validity of the proposed methodology.",

        "abstract": "In real-world driving scenarios, the model mismatch can severely impair the robustness of the tracking system controlled by Model Predictive Control (MPC). Tube-based MPC (TMPC) addresses this problem by keeping the model mismatch error in an invariant tube. The TMPC algorithms, however, cannot deal with state-dependent uncertainty since TMPC relies on the fixed tubes. This paper presents a practical algorithm for improving the capability of TMPC to handle multiplicative uncertainty. Firstly, this algorithm adopts a Homothetic Tube-based MPC (HTMPC) framework to optimize the system’s future trajectory and tube geometry simultaneously, which dynamically resizes tubes according to uncertainty and the system’s current state. Secondly, this algorithm provides both the feasible formulation of the tube and the homothetic factor with low computational complexity. Thirdly, we aim to systematically evaluate the algorithm’s robustness by the simulations of different scenarios where the system parameters and the measurement noises might change over time. We have conducted and analyzed the Monte-Carlo simulations to compare the robustness and tracking capability of the proposed algorithm and other control algorithms. The comparative analysis shows that the HTMPC algorithm provides a higher level of performance than MPC and TMPC, and it performs closely to the robust controller based on the immersion and invariance (I&I) principle.",

        "abstract": "Liver cancer remains one of the main causes of mortality worldwide, requiring advancements in diagnostic systems for early detection and improved patient outcomes. Computed tomography (CT) scans are crucial in the diagnosis of liver cancer, providing detailed images for medical analysis. Despite the triumph of convolutional neural networks in medical image analysis, challenges such as overfitting, limited labeled data, and complex tumor morphology hinder accurate detection of liver cancer. This study proposes a novel architecture, the cascaded UNet convolutional long short-term model (CUNet-CLSTM), which leverages the strengths of UNet and convolutional long short-term memory to improve liver segmentation and tumor detection in CT images. The anticipated CUNet-CLSTM model evaluated on two benchmark datasets: LiTS and 3DICARDB. The experimental results show excellent performance, achieving the best DICE values of 91.3% for liver segmentation and 96.1% for tumor detection on the LiTS dataset, and 96.3% for liver segmentation and 98.3% for tumor detection on the 3DICARDB dataset. Compared to state-of-the-art models, the proposed CUNet-CLSTM not only improves segmentation accuracy, but also mitigates overfitting through sequential feature learning and optimizes computational efficiency by providing an end-to-end framework, reducing the complexity of multi-stage pipelines. This research contributes to addressing the urgent need for accurate methods for detecting liver cancer, facilitating early diagnosis, and customized treatment strategies.",

The need to guarantee continuity to care has promoted research and industry activities aimed at developing solutions for the digitalization of the procedures to be performed to provide health services, even in emergency scenarios. Digital collection, transmission, and processing of health data represent the starting point for fulfilling this innovation process but also bring heterogeneous challenges. These motivations led to the elaboration of this work, which analyzes innovative and technological tools for the development of digital health (eHealth) through the collection of multisectoral literature, produced thanks to the cooperation of varied research groups, thus providing a multidisciplinary survey. Since digital health is expected to be one of the leading applications of the sixth-generation (6G) wireless cellular networks, this paper covers the related telecommunications aspects. Furthermore, the exploitation of artificial intelligence paradigms to elaborate massive amounts of biological data is examined. Given the extreme sensitivity of health data, this paper also investigates security and privacy issues. In particular, the main techniques and approaches to guarantee security properties (i.e., anonymity, responsibility, authentication, confidentiality, integrity, non-repudiation, and revocability) are studied. Applications involving innovative electromagnetic systems for healthcare and assisted living services are described to provide an example of an eHealth scenario leveraging ICT. Finally, the telemedicine-related regulations of the European Commission are analyzed, with particular reference to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).",

        "abstract": "A better understanding of human cognitive ability-demand gap (ADG) is critical in designing assistive technology solution that is accurate and adaptive over a wide range of human-agent interaction. The main goal is to design systems that can adapt with the user’s abilities and needs over a range of cognitive tasks. It will also enable the system to provide feedback consistent with the situation. However, the latent structure and relationship between human ability to respond to cognitive task (demand on human by the agent) remains unknown. Robust modeling of cognitive ADG will be a paradigm shift from the current trends in assistive technology design. The key idea is to estimate the gap, based on human-agent cognitive task interaction. In particular, latent response model was adopted to quantify the gap. First, we used one parameter Rasch model and extended Rasch model (rating scale model, partial credit model) with dichotomous and polytomous responses, respectively. Residues between expected and observed ability scores were considered as gap parameter in case of dichotomous response. In extended Rasch modeling, response latitudes are considered as an indicator of the gap. Additionally, we performed model fitting, standard error measurement, kernel density estimation, and differential item functioning to test the suitability of Rasch model. Empirical analyses on a number of data set show that proposed analytical method can model the cognitive ADG from dichotomous and polytomous responses. In dichotomous case, the model better fits for mixed responses (combination of easy, medium, and hard) data set rather than monotonic (e.g., only easy) data. Results show that Rasch model can be reliably used to estimate cognitive gap with different cognitive task types.",

        "abstract": "Due to the inherent slow response time of diesel generators within an islanded microgrid (MG), their frequency and voltage control systems often struggle to effectively manage rapid load changes. To mitigate this challenge, energy storage systems (ESSs) emerge as pivotal solutions. Flywheel energy storage systems (FESSs) are well-suited for handling sudden power fluctuations because they can quickly deliver or absorb large amounts of electricity. On the other hand, battery energy storage systems (BESSs) excel at storing large amounts of energy for extended periods and can handle gradual changes in power demand. This research introduces a coordinated control mechanism for a mixed energy storage setup that combines BESS and FESS elements to manage the frequency of a standalone MG. A new frequency detection method is employed to assign high, medium, and low-frequency deviations in power distribution to FESS, BESS, and diesel generators, respectively. Simulations are carried out to determine the exact performance of the proposed control method. The MATLAB/Simulink software platform is used to run these simulations. Furthermore, dynamic load changes are precisely emulated using a programmable load emulator enhancing the reliability and relevance of our analysis.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, a joint pilot and data power allocation problem with max-min fair energy efficiency (EE) guarantee in the uplink massive multiple-input multiple-output cognitive radio networks is investigated. Given the fractional objective function, channel estimation errors, and inter-user interference, the joint allocation problem is formulated as a nonconvex and NP-hard problem. To tackle this, we transform the original problem into its convex form by introducing auxiliary variables and variable substitution, and then address it with the help of the Lagrangian dual method. Since the optimization variables are interrelated and interact on each other, it is difficult to directly obtain the closed-form solution to this problem. To settle this issue, we propose an alternative iterative algorithm to achieve the optimal power policy by a gradient-based adaption method, with its corresponding optimal Lagrangian multipliers obtained by the subgradient method. Numerical results show that the proposed approach has the best minimum EE performance and decent spectral efficiency performance. Besides, compared with the other schemes, significant saving in total transmit power and good cognitive user fairness are achieved by the proposed algorithm.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a very large–scale integration chip for a novel discrete wavelet transform (DWT) based QRS complex detection algorithm. In many aspects of electrocardiogram (ECG) analyses, QRS complex detection is the first step. For example, heart rate variability (HRV) is evaluated based on the RR interval and thus, an accurate QRS detection algorithm would substantially affect the subsequent steps in HRV analysis. On the other hand, since wireless monitoring currently remains prohibitively expensive and lowering the cost and power consumption of wireless monitoring depends upon a reduction in the complexity of the algorithm, in this study we propose a simple, reliable, low power and cost-effective QRS detection method and its VLSI implementation. Here, the task of the QRS complex detection is performed using the quadratic spline wavelet transform based wavelet packet decomposition. After a four-level DWT decomposition, in order to enhance the QRS complex a novel noise level detection is then performed. The proposed noise level detector would select two of the four wavelet coefficients and then calculate their product. As a result, in addition to DWT, the processing stage includes the product of the two selected wavelet coefficients, adaptive thresholding scheme, and the execution of decision rules. Fabricated on an 0.18-μmcomplementary metal oxide semiconductor, the 1-KHz processor draws only4.2μWof power, and the chip area is only0.83mm2. Also, the detection accuracy of the proposed method is further verified using 48 recordings from the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database (Se = 99.57%,+P=99.59%), suggesting that the proposed QRS detector may achieve a high accuracy and cost-effective QRS complex detection.",

In this paper, we investigate the feasibility and applicability of GP models for music genre classification and music emotion estimation. These are two of the main tasks in the music information retrieval (MIR) field. So far, the support vector machine (SVM) has been the dominant model used in MIR systems. Like SVM, GP models are based on kernel functions and Gram matrices; but, in contrast, they produce truly probabilistic outputs with an explicit degree of prediction uncertainty. In addition, there exist algorithms for GP hyperparameter learning-something the SVM framework lacks. In this paper, we built two systems, one for music genre classification and another for music emotion estimation using both SVM and GP models, and compared their performances on two databases of similar size. In all cases, the music audio signal was processed in the same way, and the effects of different feature extraction methods and their various combinations were also investigated. The evaluation experiments clearly showed that in both music genre classification and music emotion estimation tasks the GP performed consistently better than the SVM. The GP achieved a 13.6% relative genre classification error reduction and up to an 11% absolute increase of the coefficient of determination in the emotion estimation task.",

While dynamic index structures have been extensively utilized for indexing dynamic data, their performance in nearest neighbor search can further be improved. This paper aims to enhance SR-Tree as it has been shown to be effective for indexing high dimensional clustered data. We propose enhancements to SR-Tree structure to better handle multidimensional data and reduce query processing time. First, we improve SR-Tree using a variance-based bulk-loading algorithm to build an efficient tree structure. Second, we apply the approximation of the smallest enclosing ball and leaf-level pruning methods to improve performance of kNN queries. Third, we adapt the dual-tree algorithm for SR-Tree that outperforms sequential queries for the all-nearest neighbors problem in low-to-medium dimensional large datasets. These improvements were evaluated using real-world datasets across varying dimensionalities by comparing against several freely available indexing structure frameworks. Experimental results indicated considerable speedup over the state-of-the-art dynamic index implementation in nearest neighbor retrieval across high-dimensional conditions. This work also provides an open-source implementation of our enhancements to SR-Tree for the Rust ecosystem.",

The difference between the charging times was used to estimate the sensor inductance accurately without the uncertainty due to the tolerance of threshold voltage of the input port, which delimits these time length measurements. Experimental results show that a conventional low-power microcontroller with an embedded 16 MHz clock and 22Ωcharge resistance can be used to achieve 2μHresolution and a systematic error below 2% for a measuring range from 100μHto 10 mH.

The computer simulation results demonstrate that the controller based on the N–G model could be used to tackle the tracking-control problem with accuracy and effectiveness, together with the faster convergent speed than that based on the backstepping algorithm.

        "abstract": "Hierarchical Kriging (HK) is a promising surrogate model to fuse multi-fidelity data. In theory, HK can serve as predictor for problems with any number of input dimensions. In practice, for a problem with more than 1000 variables, it is often not affordable to build such HK model due to the high demand on the computer memory to store the spatial distance matrix and the heavy computational burden relating to the frequent inversion of the large correlation matrix. To mitigate the curse of dimensionality of HK for high-dimensional problems, an infinite-width Bayesian neural network correlation function is developed and incorporated to the HK model. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that the proposed correlation function is independent on the spatial distance and has no hyperparameters to be fine-tuned. Therefore, the demand on the consumption of computer memory and computility for the model construction can be reduced significantly. Real engineering problems, including the aerodynamic performance prediction of single axial flow compressor rotor with 31 variables, 3-stage compressor with 144 variables, and 10.5-stage compressor of 1512 variables, are established along with the collected problems to test the performance of the proposed method. Comparison among the proposed method and alternative methods are further conducted. It is observed that the proposed method performs competitive in terms of the modeling accuracy and significantly better with respect to modeling efficiency. On the 1512-dimensional problem of the prediction for the compressor pressure ratio, the proposed method can build most accurate model within 50 seconds on a personal laptop with a data set consisting of 15120 low-fidelity and 7560 high-fidelity sample data.",

VSIs have been widely used in many applications. A VSI must regulate the load voltage to its sinusoidal reference quickly and accurately without distortion. It is essential to design a voltage controller that takes into account various load conditions since it is rarely known in advance what types of loads are connected to the VSI. In particular, it is challenging to suppress the voltage harmonic distortion caused by a nonlinear load, such as a diode rectifier, while achieving fast-tracking and zero steady-state error. A controller designed by the proposed procedure guarantees robust stability of the VSI independent of the load type and value. Namely, no information about uncertainties of load is needed to stabilize the VSI. Moreover, the proposed procedure realizes zero-steady state error, fast-tracking, and low distortion. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller through comparative analysis with the proportional resonant (PR) and conventional robust controllers via simulations and experiments.",

In this paper, we describe a new way of thinking about cognitive control that embodies two basic components: learning and planning, both of which are based on two notions: 1) two-state model of the environment and the perceptor and 2) perception-action cycle, which is a distinctive characteristic of the cognitive dynamic system. Most importantly, it is shown that the cognitive control learning algorithm is a special form of Bellman's dynamic programming. Distinctive properties of the new algorithm include the following: 1) optimality of performance; 2) algorithmic convergence to optimal policy; and 3) linear law of complexity measured in terms of the number of actions taken by the cognitive controller on the environment. To validate these intrinsic properties of the algorithm, a computational experiment is presented, which involves a cognitive tracking radar that is known to closely mimic the visual brain. The experiment illustrates two different scenarios: 1) the impact of planning on learning curves of the new cognitive controller and 2) comparison of the learning curves of three different controllers, based on dynamic optimization, traditionalQ-learning, and the new algorithm. The latter two algorithms are based on the two-state model, and they both involve the use of planning.",

Initially, the orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP)-based mmR (OmMR) algorithm is proposed for stationary targets to estimate their radar cross-section (RCS) coefficients, angle, range locations together with the number of targets. Next, mMR systems with mobile targets and platform are considered, followed by development of the simultaneous OMP (SOMP)-based mMR (SmMR) algorithm for RCS, angle/range estimation together with their Doppler velocities. The proposed algorithms lead to a significant improvement in performance since they exploit the inherent sparsity of the mMR scattering scene in contrast to the conventional schemes. Two-dimensional (2D) mMR imaging procedures are also presented for both scenarios in the angle, range, and Doppler dimensions. Analytical expressions are derived for the Cramér-Rao bounds (CRBs) for the mean-squared error (MSE) of joint estimation of the RCS coefficients and Doppler velocities. Simulation results demonstrate that proposed schemes perform well even in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) scenarios with a few snapshots of the scattering environment and yield improved performance in comparison to existing sparse as well as non-sparse schemes.",

We consider the signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) over both independent and identically distributed and independent but non-identically distributed fading channels. To fully take into account the effect of CCI, we adopt a more practical parameter such as the CCI coefficient. The major difficulty in the analysis resides in the determination of the statistics of the output SINR. To settle this problem, we first present the general but relatively simplified expressions for the statistics and then the related outage probability in closed-form. Furthermore, to consider more practical scenario, based on the fact that the number of participating relays can be random, we investigate the average outage probability by averaging the number of participating relays.",

However, recent privacy regulations, particularly the EU General Data Protection Regulation, have restricted the collection and usage of human images in research. As a result, several previously published face data sets have been removed from the internet due to inadequate data collection methods and privacy concerns. While synthetic data sets have been suggested as an alternative, they fall short of accurately representing the real data distribution. Additionally, most existing data sets are labeled for just a single task, which limits their versatility. To address these limitations, we introduce the Multi-Task Face (MTF) data set, designed for various tasks including face recognition and classification by race, gender, and age, as well as for aiding in training generative networks. The MTF data set comes in two versions: a non-curated set containing 132,816 images of 640 individuals, and a manually curated set with 5,246 images of 240 individuals, meticulously selected to maximize their classification quality. Both data sets were ethically sourced, using publicly available celebrity images in full compliance with copyright regulations. Along with providing detailed descriptions of data collection and processing, we evaluated the effectiveness of the MTF data set in training five deep learning models across the aforementioned classification tasks, achieving up to 98.88% accuracy for gender classification, 95.77% for race classification, 97.60% for age classification, and 79.87% for face recognition with the ConvNeXT model.

However, D2D communications can also serve as a technology component for providing public protection and disaster relief (PPDR) and national security and public safety (NSPS) services. In the United States, for example, spectrum has been reserved in the 700-MHz band for an LTE-based public safety network. The key requirement for the evolving broadband PPDR and NSPS services capable systems is to provide access to cellular services when the infrastructure is available and to efficiently support local services even if a subset or all of the network nodes become dysfunctional due to public disaster or emergency situations. This paper reviews some of the key requirements, technology challenges, and solution approaches that must be in place in order to enable LTE networks and, in particular, D2D communications, to meet PPDR and NSPS-related requirements.

Next, we enhance the selection of the “Don’t Care” elements-which are neither foreground nor background-by using an interval instead of a point, zero, proposed in prior work. We then apply linear operations to these Don’t Care elements that are by definition excluded from the transform, allowing them to be included in the parameter update during the optimization process. Finally, we propose to piece-wise linearize the hit-or-miss transform to make it robust against variations and noises. Experiment results using a deep neural network architecture, MobileNetV2, on Cifar-10 and FashionMNIST datasets demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed methods. In particular, the piecewise linear hit-or-miss transform improved the baseline accuracy for Cifar-10 by 10.7%.",

In the systemic level viewpoint, we jointly investigate the two-way information transmission between the two nodes under the unique external power supply constraint at the master node. In particular, three typical receivers are considered, including the optimum receiver, the orthogonal receiver and the power splitting receiver. We explicitly characterize the achievable capacity-rate region and discuss the effect of signal processing power consumption at the child node. We also derive the boundary of the achievable capacity-rate region, which illustrates the most energy-efficient transmission strategy of the system. Simulation results confirm the substantial gain of employing capacity-rate region achieving transmission strategies and employing optimal receivers. Moreover, we present a typical application of our results, where the required transmit power is minimized to green the system.",

Apart from maintaining profitability, energy efficiency means a decrease in the overall environmental effects, which is a serious concern in today's world. Using a femtocell in Internet of Things (IoT) can boost energy efficiency. To illustrate, femtocells can be used in smart homes, which is a subpart of the smart grid, as a communication mechanism in order to manage energy efficiency. Moreover, femtocells can be used in many IoT applications in order to provide communication. However, it is important to evaluate the energy efficiency of femtocells. This paper investigates recent advances and challenges in the energy efficiency of the femtocell in IoT. First, we introduce the idea of femtocells in the context of IoT and their role in IoT applications. Next, we describe prominent performance metrics in order to understand how the energy efficiency is evaluated. Then, we elucidate how energy can be modeled in terms of femtocell and provide some models from the literature. Since femtocells are used in heterogeneous networks to manage energy efficiency, we also express some energy efficiency schemes for deployment. The factors that affect the energy usage of a femtocell base station are discussed and then the power consumption of user equipment under femtocell coverage is mentioned. Finally, we highlight prominent open research issues and challenges.",

        "title": "Do Structured Flowcharts Outperform Pseudocode? Evidence From Eye Movements",
        "abstract": "Computational thinking is a key universal competence, often taught using methods specific to computer science. One step towards achieving it is learning to analyse and create algorithms. Researchers have long been trying to establish how the form of representation of algorithms (pseudocode versus flowchart) affects its understanding and have reached varying, sometimes conflicting results. This article presents findings that provide objective new data on this topic. In our experiment, we used two different types of algorithmic tasks with three levels of complexity and a group of 114 research participants with varying programming skills. In addition, we used an eye tracking technique that allowed us to collect detailed information about the subjects’ attention distribution during analysis of algorithms. Our results show that subjects took significantly less time to analyse flowcharts (than they did with pseudocode), made much fewer errors, and had higher confidence in the correctness of their solution. Based on eye tracking data, a reduced number of both re-analyses of the algorithm and input data re-referencing was observed for graphically presented tasks. The difference in favour of flowcharts was revealed (with few exceptions) for all levels of algorithm complexity (simple, medium, complex), while regarding the duration of analysis the advantage of flowcharts increased with the growing complexity of algorithms. For complex algorithms, a significant relationship was observed between algorithm presentation and level of programming skills versus the duration of task solving and confidence level. Our study strongly supports the idea of using graphic representation of algorithms both when learning to code and in acquiring computational thinking skills.",

        "abstract": "Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have been proliferating due to their wide applications in both military and commercial use. However, one critical challenge to WSNs implementation is source location privacy. In this paper, we propose a novel tree-based diversionary routing scheme for preserving source location privacy using hide and seek strategy to create diversionary or decoy routes along the path to the sink from the real source, where the end of each diversionary route is a decoy (fake source node), which periodically emits fake events. Meanwhile, the proposed scheme is able to maximize the network lifetime of WSNs. The main idea is that the lifetime of WSNs depends on the nodes with high energy consumption or hotspot, and then the proposed scheme minimizes energy consumption in hotspot and creates redundancy diversionary routes in nonhotspot regions with abundant energy. Hence, it achieves not only privacy preservation, but also network lifetime maximization. Furthermore, we systematically analyze the energy consumption in WSNs, and provide guidance on the number of diversionary routes, which can be created in different regions away from the sink. In addition, we identify a novel attack against phantom routing, which is widely used for source location privacy preservation, namely, direction-oriented attack. We also perform a comprehensive analysis on how the direction-oriented attack can be defeated by the proposed scheme. Theoretical and experimental results show that our scheme is very effective to improve the privacy protection while maximizing the network lifetime.",

The crash data set from 2003 to 2005 maintained by the Nevada Department of Transportation is employed to illustrate the performance of the proposed model. The results show that average travel speed, signal spacing, driveway density, and annual average daily traffic on each lane are significantly influencing factors on crash rate, and logistic QR is verified as an alternative method in predicting crash rate.",

In intricate and dynamic operational contexts, especially during ultra-low altitude missions, inadequate communication and coordination impede UAVs’ capacity to avoid other UAVs and moving objects. In this instance, attaining accurate path planning for UAVs constitutes a significant technological problem that requires immediate attention. This paper introduces an innovative algorithm, ST-D3QN, which leverages deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to optimize UAV trajectories based on optimizing the Dueling Double Deep Q-Network (D3QN) and A* (A-star) algorithm. Our approach refines the optimization of sparse rewards by toggling between the two methods, thereby maximizing the long-term benefits for UAVs. The greedy strategy has been refined to prevent the algorithm from becoming ensnared in local optima. Our proposed method is benchmarked against state-of-the-art path planning algorithms through meticulously designed simulation tests. The experimental results indicate that the ST-D3QN algorithm achieves the fastest convergence rate during training and excels in optimizing sparse rewards. It also significantly reduces the risk of collisions and enhances the success rates of UAV path planning, establishing itself as an efficient and effective solution for determining the shortest path for UAVs in complex environments.",

        "abstract": "Weighted K-Means (WKM) algorithms are increasingly important with the increase of data dimension. WKM faces an initialization problem that is more complicated than K-Means’ because in addition to picking initial cluster centers, it should also provide feature weights. Moreover, the one-dimensional solution to WKM’s widely used objective function is unacceptable in most cases. Yet, the initialization of WKM, especially the initialization of feature weight, has been largely ignored. This paper studies the problem by analyzing Feature weight self-adjustment K-Means(FWSA K-Means), a popular WKM proposed to avoid the one-dimensional solution. Experimental results suggest that the algorithm is actually easy to cluster mainly based on a single feature information when it is not well initialized. Moreover, the paper argues that initial feature weights and cluster centers are equally important in determining the final partition. Therefore it suggests using feature level constraints to improve the initialization and proposes a semi-supervised algorithm Constrained FWSA K-Means (CFWSA K-Means). The algorithm uses constraints in evaluating feature weights and clusters to guide their evolution at the stage of initialization. Experimental results suggest that it is effective and robust in utilizing constraints. In addition, if its initialization process is started by the cluster centers provided by BRIk, an initialization approach for K-Means, the performance can be further improved.",

For instance, big data is commonly unstructured and require more real-time analysis. This development calls for new system architectures for data acquisition, transmission, storage, and large-scale data processing mechanisms. In this paper, we present a literature survey and system tutorial for big data analytics platforms, aiming to provide an overall picture for nonexpert readers and instill a do-it-yourself spirit for advanced audiences to customize their own big-data solutions. First, we present the definition of big data and discuss big data challenges. Next, we present a systematic framework to decompose big data systems into four sequential modules, namely data generation, data acquisition, data storage, and data analytics. These four modules form a big data value chain. Following that, we present a detailed survey of numerous approaches and mechanisms from research and industry communities. In addition, we present the prevalent Hadoop framework for addressing big data challenges. Finally, we outline several evaluation benchmarks and potential research directions for big data systems.",

In order to accommodate such emerging applications, several leading countries including the USA, South-Korea, Brazil and Canada released 1200 MHz of the spectrum in the 6 GHz band for the unlicensed use cases. Other countries, including European Union member states, only released the lower 500 MHz of the 6 GHz band and have yet to decide on the future use of the upper 6 GHz band.

This approach enables organizations to enforce adaptable, scalable and context-aware security policies that can dynamically respond to evolving threats and operational demands. However, the growing complexity of distributed systems and the interdependencies between diverse security components present significant challenges in ensuring consistent and efficient policy enforcement. Static and centralized security models are no longer sufficient to address these challenges, underscoring the need for intelligent, distributed solutions that can optimize policy deployment in real-time. This paper introduces a novel framework based on Message Passing algorithms that enables decentralized, adapted and optimized policy deployment across complex cybersecurity infrastructures. More specifically, we extend the traditional Min-Sum algorithm by incorporating dynamic trust weights that influence policy enforcement decisions, allowing more reliable nodes to have a greater impact while mitigating the risks posed by untrusted entities. The proposed framework is designed to handle large-scale network environments with minimal computational overhead, relying on localized message exchanges instead of centralized computations. We benchmark our framework against state-of-the-art approaches, demonstrating that the proposed framework achieves lower total enforcement cost while significantly improving convergence speed, particularly in heterogeneous trust environments. Finally, we provide an in-depth evaluation of how trust heterogeneity influences security policy enforcement. Extensive simulations were conducted to evaluate the framework’s effectiveness in optimizing policy deployment for varying network topologies, demonstrating significant improvements in threat detection accuracy, policy consiste...",

        "abstract": "Self-organizing networks act autonomously for the sake of achieving the best possible performance. The attainable routing depends on a delicate balance of diverse and often conflicting quality-of-service requirements. Finding the optimal solution typically becomes an nonolynomial-hard problem, as the network size increases in terms of the number of nodes. Moreover, the employment of user-defined utility functions for the aggregation of the different objective functions often leads to suboptimal solutions. On the other hand, Pareto optimality is capable of amalgamating the different design objectives by providing an element of elitism. Although there is a plethora of bioinspired algorithms that attempt to address this optimization problem, they often fail to generate all the points constituting the optimal Pareto front. As a remedy, we propose an optimal multiobjective quantum-assisted algorithm, namely the nondominated quantum optimization algorithm (NDQO), which evaluates the legitimate routes using the concept of Pareto optimality at a reduced complexity. We then compare the performance of the NDQO algorithm to the state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithms, demonstrating that the NDQO algorithm achieves a near-optimal performance. Furthermore, we analytically derive the upper and lower bounds of the NDQO algorithmic complexity, which is of the order ofO(N)andO(NN−−√)in the best and worst case scenario, respectively. This corresponds to a substantial complexity reduction of the NDQO from the order ofO(N2)imposed by the brute-force method.",

Therefore, an apt solution to overcome these significant limitations is to: (a) replace the ground wheel and chain-gear based disc driving mechanism with a drive-by-wire system that comprises motors and sensors for variable rate planting and (b) incorporate a two-level adjustment of the applied negative pressure in the vacuum chamber for two different types of seeds, and (c) design seed metering unit that can plant multiple types of crops without any use of multiple discs. This paper presents the design and working of a novel variable rate multi-crop pneumatic seed metering unit that addresses the limitations of conventional seed planters. Laboratory tests were carried out on our proposed metering unit for maize and soybean seeds at varying rates in compliance with travel speeds. Experimental evaluation of the developed metering unit was performed on a lab test bench in terms of accuracy, average miss counts, and average multiple counts at various rotational speeds. The experimental results proved that our developed multi-crop seed metering unit performed significantly better than the conventional seed metering units by obtaining the average miss-count of 5.4 seeds, average multiple-count of 2.5 seeds, and coefficient of variation in spacing (precision) of 0.34 inches for a set of travel speeds of 2 km/h to 4 km/h.",

Concurrently, an object detector was employed to spatially and semantically localize and classify the objects with which the worker in the image was interacting.

The objective of this paper is to develop and evaluate a new system, Elderly Care GPT, aimed at improving the control of robots for home healthcare services.

In real-world evaluations, Elderly Care GPT is compared with LLaMA3 and LLaMA3+ Prompt Words, and a comparison is made with mainstream models used for controlling robots on the market. The results show that Elderly Care GPT achieves a task success rate of up to 97.3%, demonstrating exceptional performance.

The computational cost of determining a 2’s complementary circuit and neglecting the sign bit extension of each partial product row in the Modified Booth Encoding (MBE) algorithm is effectively eliminated by BPR algorithm. The unsigned mantissa multiplication using partial product array reduction with the BPR technique uses 27.5% less area, 18% less power, and 33.33% improved speed for generating one partial product row than conventional Booth multipliers. The8×8and16×16multipliers are used to verify the BPR binary multipliers on TSMC 65nm 1.1 V CMOS standard cell library and the synthesis reports are compared with the conventional and best-reported improved Booth multipliers. Finally, the MAC design uses 16-bit FP arithmetic with an8×8mantissa multiplier for the CNN accelerator is developed, and it is validated with suitable error metrics like Mean Relative Error (MRE) to assess the suggested architecture for AI applications.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a novel approach that employs classification to enhance the accuracy of the stereo matching problem. First, the images are treated in order to improve their pixel to pixel correspondence and reduce illumination differences. After that, stereo matching is addressed using different methods with emphasis on local ones like the sum of absolute distances and normalized cross correlation. Other state-of-the-art approaches are also considered. Then, and for every pixel, different features are computed from the input stereo image and the initially found depth map. Afterward, boosting and neural networks, as classification methods, are used to handle occlusion and enhance stereo matching by finding the erroneous disparity values. These values are then corrected through a completion stage. The accuracy of the proposed implementation improves on the problem in an efficient manner. A timing analysis of the method is provided to validate the real time performance. This paper further clarifies some of the possible developments based on various discussions.",

        "abstract": "The performance of evolutionary algorithms (EAs), suitable for optimization on static functional landscapes, usually degrade in presence of noises with different statistical features. In this paper, we present a simple variant of the differential evolution (DE) algorithm, one of the most competitive EAs of recent interest, to tackle complex optimization problems in the presence of additive noise. The proposed DE variant is equipped with three new algorithmic components. A new population central tendency-based mutation scheme is proposed and it is switched in a probabilistic manner with the difference mean-based perturbation strategy in the mutation step. Instead of the regular binomial or exponential crossover of DE, we adopt a blending crossover during the recombination stage. Finally, a novel distance-based selection mechanism is incorporated to enable the occasional inclusion of a few inferior solutions to future generations, thus making the usual DE selection less greedy. Five different additive noise models namely Gaussian, Poisson, Rayleigh, Exponential, and Random are considered with a variety of noise amplitudes to simulate the noisy behavior of the objective functions. In total, 79 benchmark functions from traditional, as well as modern (IEEE CEC 2013 and 2017) test-suites, are used to extensively compare and contrast the proposed method with the other state-of-art evolutionary optimization algorithms, tailor-made for noisy function optimization. Experimental results, supported with the non-parametric statistical tests, indicate that our proposed method is very competitive against the noise-resilient variants of classical as well as very recent evolutionary optimizers, including the winners of the recent IEEE CEC competitions of real parameter optimization on the complex fitness landscapes.",

The dual-mode structure has two resonances serving for two three-pole passbands, respectively, in differential mode (DM) and an intrinsic suppression for full stopband in common mode (CM). Thus, it is perfectly suited to design a filtering network in DM, and conserve suppression in CM. In order to obtain two close DM channels and good CM suppression in the meantime, two inner resonators are coupled together via a specific coupling scheme with intrinsic CM suppression to construct it.

First, a describing function (DF)-based stability analysis is conducted considering the nonlinear dynamics of the incremental conductance (INC)-based maximum power point tracking (MPPT) algorithm and the effects of the PV generator operating point changes. Next, the analysis characterizes the impact of the MPPT sampling time and perturbation step size on oscillation magnitude and frequency. The study showed that a shorter sampling time and larger step size result in a faster response. However, an increase in the step size increases the oscillation magnitude; the latter does not change with the step size. Then, considering the INC-based MPPT nonlinear dynamics, the overall system’s damping and oscillatory modes are characterized under different photovoltaic generator operating conditions and system parameters using the DF method. The study showed that the system stability is reduced when the photovoltaic generator operating point moves to the left of the maximum power point and with the reduction of the dc-link capacitance and ac-side filter inductance. Therefore, an active compensation method is proposed to reduce the oscillations and improve the stability and dynamic performance at different operating conditions and in the presence of the MPPT nonlinear dynamics. Finally, detailed nonlinear time-domain simulation results are presented to validate the analytical results and the effectiveness of the proposed compensation method under various operating conditions.",

        "abstract": "In this era of technology advancement, huge amount of data is collected from different disciplines. This data needs to be stored, processed and analyzed to understand its nature. Networks or graphs arise to model real-world systems in the different fields. Early work in network theory adopted simple graphs to model systems where the system’s entities and interactions among them are modeled as nodes and static, single-type edges, respectively. However, this representation is considered limited when the system’s entities interact through different sources. Multi-view networks have recently attracted attention due to its ability to consider the different interactions between entities explicitly. An important tool to understand the structure of multi-view networks is community detection. Community detection or clustering reveals the significant communities in the network which provides dimensionality reduction and a better understanding of the network. In this paper, a new robust clustering algorithm is proposed to detect the community structure in multi-view networks. In particular, the proposed approach constructs a 3-mode tensor from the normalized adjacency matrices that represent the different views. The constructed tensor is decomposed into a self-representation and error components where the extracted self-representation tensor is used to detect the community structure of the multi-view network. Moreover, a common subspace is computed among all views where the contribution of each view to the common subspace is optimized. The proposed method is applied to several real-world data sets and the results show that the proposed method achieves the best performance compared to other state-of-the-art algorithms.",

To enhance the sparsity constraint for better imaging performance, a promising direction is to use theℓpnorm (0<p<1) and solve theℓpminimization problem. Very recently, Xu et al. developed an analytic solution for theℓ1/2regularization via an iterative thresholding operation, which is also referred to as half-threshold filtering. In this paper, we design a simultaneous algebraic reconstruction technique (SART)-type half-threshold filtering framework to solve the computed tomography (CT) reconstruction problem. In the medical imaging filed, the discrete gradient transform (DGT) is widely used to define the sparsity. However, the DGT is noninvertible and it cannot be applied to half-threshold filtering for CT reconstruction. To demonstrate the utility of the proposed SART-type half-threshold filtering framework, an emphasis of this paper is to construct a pseudoinverse transforms for DGT. The proposed algorithms are evaluated with numerical and physical phantom data sets. Our results show that the SART-type half-threshold filtering algorithms have great potential to improve the reconstructed image quality from few and noisy projections. They are complementary to the counterparts of the state-of-the-art soft-threshold filtering and hard-threshold filtering.",

Traditional Intrusion Detection Systems, based mainly on signature matching and predefined rules, present limitations in identifying emerging threats and distributed attacks due to their inability to analyze complex interactions within IoT networks. To address this problem, this study proposes a graph-based intrusion detection model using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), leveraging a dynamic representation of IoT network traffic. In this model, devices are represented as nodes and communications as weighted edges, integrating features such as communication frequency, transmitted data volume, and protocol type. The proposed method was evaluated using a customized dataset from a simulated IoT network to reflect real-world attack scenarios, including Denial of Service, Spoofing, and Man-in-the-Middle. Experimental results demonstrate that our GNN-based model significantly outperforms traditional machine learning methods, achieving an F1-Score of 0.95 and an AUC-ROC of 0.98, compared to values between 0.84 and 0.91 for Support Vector Machines and Random Forests. Furthermore, the system reduces the false positive rate by 40% compared to signature-based IDS, improving its applicability in operational environments. The model also proved scalable, maintaining an inference time of 2.5 ms per sample on graphs of up to 10,000 nodes, making it viable for real-time deployment. These findings confirm that graph-based anomaly detection is a promising approach for securing large-scale IoT infrastructures, providing increased precision, adaptability, and robustness against emerging cyber threats.",

In this paper, we briefly review the definition of the cluster space framework and introduce a new cluster space dynamic model. This model represents the dynamics of the formation as a whole as a function of the dynamics of the member robots. Given this model, generalized cluster space forces can be applied to the formation, and a Jacobian transpose controller can be implemented to transform cluster space compensation forces into robot-level forces to be applied to the robots in the formation. Then, a nonlinear model-based partition controller is proposed. This controller cancels out the formation dynamics and effectively decouples the cluster space variables. Computer simulations and experimental results using three autonomous surface vessels and four land rovers show the effectiveness of the approach. Finally, sensitivity to errors in the estimation of cluster model parameters is analyzed.",

The core task is to determine the presence of ship targets in remote sensing images and to perform detection, classification, and localization. However, ship targets in remote sensing images exhibit multi-scale characteristics, complex backgrounds, and varying meteorological conditions, leading to challenges such as low detection accuracy, false positives, and missed detections, particularly for small-scale ships. To address these issues, we propose an effective ship detection algorithm—Ship Detection Transformer (Ship-DETR). First, we introduce the high-low frequency (HiLo) attention into the intra-scale feature interaction module to enhance the extraction of both high- and low-frequency features, reduce computational complexity, and improve detection performance. To strengthen the model’s multi-scale fusion capability for ship features of different scales, we incorporate the bidirectional feature pyramid network (BiFPN) to optimize cross-scale feature fusion and add theS2features to further enhance the representation of small-scale ship features. Additionally, we replace traditional downsampling operations with the Haar wavelet-based downsampling (HWD) module, which reduces the spatial resolution of feature maps while preserving edge and texture details as much as possible, thereby minimizing feature information loss. Experimental results on the LEVIR-Ship dataset and the HRSC2016-MS dataset demonstrate that Ship-DETR improves the ship detection accuracy while maintaining a small number of parameters and computational load. Ship-DETR achieved a mean average precision of 75.7% and 73.1% on the two datasets, respectively, representing an improvement of 3.5% and 1.9% compared to the baseline model.

Two transmission zeros are introduced to obtain high isolation and selectivity between the two passbands by placing them in the appropriate position. Proper feeding position is selected to further improve the attenuation of stopband. The measured results highly agree with the simulated one. Measured results demonstrate the isolation level of 40 dB, attenuation of larger than 28 dB, and a wide stopband.",

Given a 3D facial key point sequence extracted from any reference video, and a target audio clip, the neural pipeline learns how to generate head pose aware, identity aware landmarks and outputs accurate 3D lip motion directly at the inference stage. These generated landmarks can be used to render a photo-realistic video via an additional image to image conversion stage. In this paper, a novel data augmentation technique is introduced that increases the size of the training dataset from N audio/visual pairs up to NxN unique pairs for the task of automatic dubbing.

Traditional depression detection techniques, however, struggle to handle the informal, often ambiguous nature of language used in social media, including emojis, slang, and context-dependent expressions. To address this limitation, this research proposes a novel framework for depression detection that integrates advanced text preprocessing with a deep learning model. The preprocessing pipeline contains two key components where emojis are converted into text by emoji normalization then slang expressions are replaced through a customized dictionary. Emotion scores serve as additional components to identify depression-related emotional cues within the text. The model combines BERT’s contextual embeddings with BiLSTM’s sequential processing power to effectively represent emotional content in social media posts. The proposed approach demonstrates superior performance compared to traditional baseline models by achieving better results in accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, AUC and RGA. This approach shows exceptional performance in detecting depression through informal texts which serves as a new benchmark for depression detection in dynamic social media environments.",

        "abstract": "Jamming attacks significantly degrade the performance of wireless communication systems and can lead to significant overhead in terms of re-transmissions and increased power consumption. Although different jamming techniques are discussed in the literature, numerous open-source implementations have used expensive equipment in the range of thousands of dollars, with the exception of a few. These implementations have also tended to be partial-band and do not cover the whole available bandwidth of the system under attack. In this work, we demonstrate that flexible, reliable, and low-priced software-defined radio (SDR) jamming is feasible by designing and implementing different types of jammers against IEEE 802.11n networks. First, to demonstrate the optimal jamming waveform, we present an analytical bit error rate expression of the system under attack by employing two common jamming waveforms: Gaussian noise and digitally modulated in an additive white Gaussian noise channel to obtain a lower bound performance. Then, we validated the finding obtained by the analysis via realistic end-to-end simulations using the MATLAB WLAN toolbox. Afterwards, we implement JamRF, a toolkit that employs a low-cost SDR to implement numerous types of jammers to further validate the analysis and simulation findings. The obtained results demonstrated that the Gaussian noise waveform outperformed the digitally modulated waveforms. Furthermore, in terms of jamming attack strategies, experimental results showed that to jam the whole 2.4GHz spectrum, a stateful-reactive jammer employing a random channel hopping jamming strategy achieves a packet loss ratio above 90%.",

The asymptotic concavity of the sum rate of the system is utilized to form the proposed power allocation approach. In contrast to the traditional approaches, the proposed approach utilizes a channel asymptotic orthogonality-based approximation which is more suitable, thus achieves higher spectral efficiency. The analysis demonstrates that the sum rate of the system increases as the number of antennas increases. Numerical results verify the analysis and show that the proposed approach can perform better than those traditional approaches.",

        "abstract": "Data sparsity presents a significant challenge for Recommendation Systems, particularly in neighborhood-based approaches that rely on co-ratings to compute similarity. As co-ratings decrease, these methods often struggle to generate accurate recommendations. Addressing the persistent challenge of data sparsity, a novel similarity method, hybrid item-based, for multi-criteria collaborative filtering is proposed in this study. The proposed approach introduces a local similarity measure that combines a modified Jaccard similarity with a distance-based method, enhancing item-to-item similarity calculations. Additionally, it incorporatesα-divergence as a global similarity measure, leveraging the probability density distribution of ratings to compute similarities even when user overlap is minimal or absent. This dual approach allows our method to produce reliable similarity measures in sparse data environments. The results of experimental evaluations conducted on multiple datasets illustrate that the proposed approach demonstrates a superior performance than existing traditional and hybrid approaches in terms of accuracy and achieves notable improvements in recall and F1-measure. Furthermore, the proposed method exhibits high diversity and competitive novelty, striking an optimal balance that enhances user engagement. These results underline the proposed method’s potential as a comprehensive solution, offering improved accuracy, diversity, and relevance, particularly in sparse data contexts.",

In this paper, we develop methods for robust and resilient six-transistor-cell static random access memory (6T-SRAM) designs that mitigate the effects of device and circuit parameter variations. Our interdisciplinary effort involves: 1) using our own recently developed VAR-TX model [1] to illustrate the impact of interdie (also known as die-to-die, D2D) and intradie (also know as within-die, WID) process and operation variations—namely threshold voltage (Vth), gate length (L), and supply voltage (Vdd)—on future different 16-nm architectures and 2) using modified versions of other well-received models to illustrate the impact of variability due to temperature, negative bias temperature instability, aging, and so forth, on existing and next-generation technology nodes. Our goal in combining modeling techniques is to help minimize all major types of variability and to consequently predict and optimize speed and yield for the next generation 6T-SRAMs.",

        "abstract": "Vital signals monitoring is expected to support people in their daily activities in the near future, following continuous strides in developing health technologies for complex and hazardous environments. As the industry 4.0 revolution grows, robotic systems are increasingly deployed to support health monitoring, even though current robotic systems merely enable navigation and exploration of the surrounding environment to find people to be monitored, without adaptation of their behaviour to improve the quality of the health monitoring. At the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN), a wireless personnel safety prototype has been developed to assist workers in harsh environments, although this system needs to be improved in terms of invasiveness and portability. This work proposes a novel contactless approach based on a robotic system that adapts its behaviour to improve the performance of imaging-based algorithm for continuous physiological monitoring. Specifically, cardiac activity is monitored from camera views to obtain non-invasive and reliable vital parameter measurements. An extensive experiment has been conducted with ten healthy volunteers. The participants’ heart rates were monitored at different distances and different camera zoom levels from the robotic system, and synchronously measured by a heart rate benchmark device for the ground truth. The results highlighted several distance-zoom combinations that can be reached by the robotic system to adapt its behaviour to the boundary conditions in order to minimize the heart rate measurement error during algorithm calculations. These distance-zoom combinations are used to implement the control of the robotic system, improve the heart rate calculation algorithm and overcome the limitations of previous systems. A comparison with previous works in the literature involving the cardiac activity algorithm reveals a consistent contribution of the robot-assisted contactless monitoring system in reducing the m...",

        "abstract": "2-D printed electronics have been the focus of intense research for the past two decades primarily focused on implementing electrical interconnect by dispensing conductive binder-based inks. More recently, traditional printed electronics processes have been leveraged within 3-D printed structures where components and interconnect are introduced during fabrication interruptions. The dielectric performance of 3-D printed materials compares well with traditional printed circuit board (PCB) dielectrics but one remaining challenge is the low conductivity of printed ink traces. The performance degradation is due to curing temperature limits imposed by the properties of the polymer substrates. Thermoplastics, such as ULTEM, can maintain form at over 200 °C, but production ink curing processes require 850 °C to provide an appropriate conductivity. Previous reports have described submerging wires with selective energy within a thermoplastic substrate upon which 3-D printing can continue uninhibited. As copper wires have the same conductivity as PCBs and can be implemented in a wide range of cross-sectional areas, 3-D printed electronics are now in a position to transform the electronics industry. This paper describes an inter-layer process to insert metal connection between layers-allowing for improved routing density and leveraging the geometries brought to bear by 3-D printing. Minimum placement distance between these 3-D printed vias was initially 1.5 mm, and the vias can connect layers separated by as much as 2.8 mm in the vertical build direction (z-axis). As the number of wires layers that can be fabricated is not as limited as traditional board lamination, complex routing can be realized within mass customized, arbitrary shapes.",

        "abstract": "The rapid development of information technology, especially the advancements in fields such as the Internet of Things (IoT), is driving significant changes in campuses. This change has a wide impact, covering many fields, such as educational resource allocation, student services, and campus security. In this context, smart campus resource information management (SCRIM) has emerged as a key strategy to facilitate these transformations. SCRIM leverages IoT to collect resource information on campus space, environment, transportation, energy, emissions, water, and various events. By comprehensively analyzing this resource information, SCRIM can implement measures such as energy-saving control, optimized space management and allocation, and disaster management to achieve the best utilization of campus resources. Although it has gradually gained popularity, current research lacks a comprehensive research summary. This study mainly selected SCRIM-related literature for investigation between 2019 and 2024. Evaluation criteria were established through campus resource information, security and privacy, and SCRIM framework. This paper introduces SCRIM, detailing its models and technologies, and emphasizes the importance of occupancy detection and the integration of knowledge graphs to facilitate more efficient data analysis. It provides a detailed comparison, analysis, and discussion of various SCRIM frameworks, highlighting their current challenges and issues.

The model has much higher accuracy and better robustness than commonly used circuit equivalent models over a wide range of bandwidths. Moreover, a compact 3D spiral inductor using ground TSV is designed based on the DNN model.

Therefore, this paper provides an attempt to study a multi-objective two-sided disassembly line balancing problem considering interactions among precedence free tasks, and establishes a mathematical model from efficiency and environment concerns. Due to NP-hard nature of the presented problem, a novel hybrid discrete artificial bee colony algorithm is proposed based on the problem knowledge of the problem to obtain satisfactory solutions within a short computational time. A new encoding scheme based on one-dimensional integer array is designed to represent feasible solutions. A random initialization method based on Logistic chaotic mapping is used to produce an initial population with diversity. The INSERT, SWAP and MUTATION operators developed according to the characteristics of the problem are employed to construct the set of neighborhoods for the VNS method to exploit new solutions. Instead of randomly exploring new solutions in the whole solution space, a MUTATION operator performed on the current best solution is designed to avoid inefficiency in the exploration progress. The effectiveness and superiority of the proposed algorithm are verified by a series of instances. The analysis results indicate that the proposed algorithm is suitable to solve the presented problem as well as its variants and shows superior performance.

        "abstract": "Domain Name System (DNS) injection is a censorship method for blocking access to blacklisted domain names. The method uses deep packet inspection on all DNS queries passing through the network and injects spoofed responses. Compared with other blocking mechanisms, DNS injection impacts uninvolved third-parties if their traffic is routed through a censored network. In this paper, we look for large deployments of DNS injection, measured from vantage points outside of the censored networks. DNS injection is known to be used in China since it leaked unintentionally into foreign networks. We find that DNS injection is also used in Iran and can be observed by sending DNS queries to Iranian networks. In mid 2013, the Iranian DNS filter was temporarily suspended for some names, which correlated with media coverage of political debates in Iran about blocking social media. Spoofed responses from China and Iran can be detected passively by the IP address returned. We propose an algorithm to obtain these addresses remotely. After testing 255002 open resolvers outside of China, we determined that 6% are potentially affected by Chinese DNS injection when querying top-level domains outside of China. This is essentially the result of one top-level domain name server for which an anycast instance is hosted in China.",

        "abstract": "Smartphones are computationally constrained compared with server devices due to their size and limited battery-based power. Compute-intensive tasks are often offloaded from smartphones to high-performance computing opportunities provided by nearby high-end cloud and edge servers. ARM architectures dominate smartphones, while x86 dominate server devices. The difference in architectures requires dynamic binary translation (DBT) of compiled code migration, which increases the task execution time on the cloud servers. Multimedia applications contain a large number of vector instructions (single instruction multiple data) that are compute and resource intensive. Vector instructions optimize application execution by parallel processing multiple data points in a single instruction. However, DBT of vector instructions losses the parallelism and optimization due to vector-scalar translations. We present and analyze a framework for pre-compiled vector instruction translation and offloading in heterogeneous compute architectures that avoids the execution overhead of compiled code offloading. The framework maps and translates ARM vector intrinsics to x86 vector intrinsics such that an application programmed for ARM architecture can be executed on the x86 architecture without any modification. We analyze the code offloading framework with static code analysis to determine the optimal compilers and corresponding compilation parameters. Moreover, we analyze the overhead of the vector instruction translator and application profiler. Furthermore, the comparative analysis based on increasing computational sizes reveals that our framework provides 78.8% energy efficiency as compared with existing code translation and offloading frameworks.",

Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is known as a new model that separates the control plane and the data plane, and is anticipated as a favorable solution for implementing Blockchain, to offer the scalability and adaptability required for IoT. The scalability of the network rises in direct proportion to the users’ enhanced privacy on the network. Blockchain and SDN are two top innovations utilized to create secure network architectures and provide trustworthy data transmission. They offer a strong and trustworthy platform to deal with dangers and problems, including security, privacy, adaptability, scalability, and secrecy. Unfortunately, the attackers can still inject traffic to disrupt a blockchain node’s regular functions. This study provides an optimized Blockchain-based SD IoT architecture for smart networks that is safe and energy-efficient. In this work, it is concentrated on blockchain-based SDN and creates an SDN-Blockchain Classifier. This IDS-based security tool provides a trust-based classifier by handling and reducing harmful traffic through traffic fusion and aggregation.

However, conventional adaptive linear equalizers suffer from performance degradation and slow convergence in the underwater acoustic channel with large delay spread. To solve this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel adaptive decision-feedback equalizer (DFE) based on the minimum symbol-error rate (MSER) criterion. Specifically, by taking the sample-by-sample adaptation into account, the problem is first formulated as minimizing the norm between two consecutive adaptations under the constraint that the latest adaptation will provide correct detection for both the current and past symbols. Then we solve the optimization problem by using the Lagrange multiplier method to obtain the adaptive DFE that minimizes the sequential symbol detection error with a fast convergence rate. Simulation results show that the proposed MSER-based adaptive DFE significantly outperforms the existing equalizers in terms of convergence speed and steady-state performance for underwater acoustic channels.",

As the current link directly determines the torque/levitation characteristics, the selection of the inverter topology and the design of the modulation scheme are the keys to determining the current control performance of BM. The available inverter topologies (full bridge topology, staggered parallel topology and split capacitor topology) and their corresponding modulation schemes for two-phase BM, which are sinusoidal pulse width modulation (SPWM) and space vector pulse width modulation (SVPWM), are compared and analyzed in detail from the perspective of four dimensions, i.e., system cost, control performance, voltage utilization, and algorithm complexity. The staggered parallel topology is selected as the inverter topology for two-phase BM in this paper for its low system cost and high control performance, and an improved SPWM scheme, which increases the voltage utilization from 50% to 71%, is proposed. It is worth mentioning that the idea of carrier phase shifting is applied to the two-phase BM drive system in this paper to improve the system efficiency further. Finally, based on a set of 4000rpm/100W two-phase BM prototype platform, the inverter topology and its modulation scheme explored in this paper are given a complete comparison of simulation and experimental quantitative data to demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed improved two-phase BM SPWM drive scheme based on the staggered parallel topology.",

        "abstract": "A number of impedance-based fault location algorithms have been developed for estimating the distance to faults in a transmission network. Each algorithm has specific input data requirements and makes certain assumptions that may or may not hold true in a particular fault location scenario. Without a detailed understanding of the principle of each fault-locating method, choosing the most suitable fault location algorithm can be a challenging task. This paper, therefore, presents the theory of one-ended (simple reactance, Takagi, modified Takagi, Eriksson, and Novosel et al.) and two-ended (synchronized, unsynchronized, and current-only) impedance-based fault location algorithms and demonstrates their application in locating real-world faults. The theory details the formulation and input data requirement of each fault-locating algorithm and evaluates the sensitivity of each to the following error sources: 1) load; 2) remote infeed; 3) fault resistance; 4) mutual coupling; 5) inaccurate line impedances; 6) DC offset and CT saturation; 7) three-terminal lines; and 8) tapped radial lines. From the theoretical analysis and field data testing, the following criteria are recommended for choosing the most suitable fault-locating algorithm: 1) data availability and 2) fault location application scenario. Another objective of this paper is to assess what additional information can be gleaned from waveforms recorded by intelligent electronic devices (IEDs) during a fault. Actual fault event data captured in utility networks is exploited to gain valuable feedback about the transmission network upstream from the IED device, and estimate the value of fault resistance.",

However, in the era of cyber-physical systems, the effectiveness of communications is not dictated simply by the bit rate, but most importantly by the efficient completion of the task in hand, e.g., controlling remotely a robot, automating a production line or collaboratively sensing through a drone swarm. In parallel, it is projected that by 2023, half of the worldwide network connections will be among machines rather than humans. In this context, it is crucial to establish a new paradigm for designing communication strategies for multi-agent cyber-physical systems. This is a daunting task, since it requires a combination of principles from information, communication, control theories and computer science in order to formalize a general framework for task-oriented communication designs. In this direction, this paper reviews and structures the relevant theoretical work across a wide range of scientific communities. Subsequently, it proposes a general conceptual framework for task-oriented communication design, along with its specializations according to targeted use cases. Furthermore, it provides a survey of relevant contributions in dominant applications, such as industrial internet of things, multi-unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems, autonomous vehicles, distributed learning systems, smart manufacturing plants, 5G and beyond self-organizing networks, and tactile internet.

        "abstract": "The rapid growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) requires innovative solutions to address the challenges posed by constrained radio spectrum resources in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). This paper presents an Artificial Intelligence (AI) based spectrum sensing framework designed to detect and classify various IoT communication technologies and generate advanced communication channel analytics, such as the technology in use, central frequency and the bandwidth of the radio channel, time-on-air parameter, channel usage patterns, and radio spectrum occupancy degree. In contrast to most existing other methods, the proposed framework follows an end-to-end approach that integrates dataset design, AI model training, and inference evaluation using IoT sensors controlled by a traffic orchestrator that emulates a large-scale, high-density WSN architecture. The system follows a complete design approach, automatically creating and enhancing datasets consisting of spectrogram images from both controlled tests and real-world scenarios (6,190 unique radio spectrograms). Using the YOLOv8 architecture, the AI model demonstrates high performance in detecting multiple narrow-band radio signals, including LoRa and Sigfox technologies, achieving precision and recall scores of 0.983 and 0.947, respectively. In live deployment tests, the framework processes spectrograms with an average latency of 30.12 ms. Through an integrated detection tracking mechanism, it efficiently generates advanced radio channel analytics, enabling better use of spectral resources and interference mitigation in large-scale IoT networks, making it a valuable tool for optimizing IoT deployments. In conclusion, the proposed framework offers significant advances in spectrum sensing methodologies, paving the way for improved scalability and reliability in the evolving IoT landscape.",

        "abstract": "This paper addresses the distributed orbit synchronization control of spacecraft formation flying under an undirected connected graph and in the presence of unknown external disturbances and communication time-delay. A nonsingular fast terminal sliding mode (NFTSM) control strategy, which can solve the singularity and slow convergence to the equilibrium problems of terminal sliding mode (TSM) control, is developed for spacecraft formation. Considering only desired signals are needed for the basis functions of Chebyshev neural networks (CNN) implemented, a CNN is employed to approximate the nonlinear function and bounded external disturbances. Based on the NFTSM and CNN approximation, a distributed finite-time synchronization control law is designed and its finite-time convergence property is proven in theory. Moreover, in order to guarantee good performance for the spacecraft formation control with communication delay, a distributed finite-time synchronization control scheme with communication delay is also given and the uniform ultimate boundedness of all signals in the closed-loop control system is proven. Finally, a numerical example is illustrated to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategies.",

        "abstract": "During the production process of steel, there are often some defects on the surface of the product. Therefore, detecting defects is the key to produce high-quality products. At the same time, the defects of the steel have caused huge losses to the high-tech industry. A steel surface defect detection algorithm based on improved YOLO-V7 is proposed to address the problems of low detection speed and low detection accuracy of traditional steel surface defect detection methods. First, we use the de-weighted BiFPN structure to make full use of the feature information to strengthen feature fusion, reduce the loss of feature information during the convolution process, and improve the detection accuracy. Secondly, the ECA attention mechanism is combined in the backbone part to strengthen the important feature channels. Finally, the original bounding box loss function is replaced by the SIoU loss function, where the penalty term is redefined by taking the vector angle between the required regressions into account. The experimental results show that the improved model proposed in this paper has higher performance compared with other comparison models. Based on our experiments, the proposed method yields 80.2% mAP and 81.9% on the GC10-DET dataset and NEU-DET dataset with high speed, which is better than other existing models.",

First, the use of the transfer matrix method to analyze plane wave propagation in such structures to determine the transmittance and reflectance is developed. Examples of cases where the Bragg bandgap and the so-called zero <n> gap can be used for possible applications in sensing are illustrated. Next, the transfer matrix approach is extended to simulate the spatial evolution of a collection of propagating and nonpropagating TE and TM plane waves (or plane wave spectra) incident on such multilayer structures. The use of the complex Poynting theorem in checking the computations, as well as monitoring powers and the stored electric or magnetic energy in any section of the multilayer stack, is illustrated, along with its use in designing alternating positive and negative index structures with optimal gain to compensate for losses in the negative index material. Finally, the robustness of PIM-NIM stacks with respect to randomness in the dimensions of the PIM-NIM structure is examined. This should be useful in determining the performance of such structures when they are physically fabricated.",

The logistical model of the game progress model and development of game refinement had led to the same measures of ‘jerk’ from the game-playing field. However, the influence of ‘jerk’ in such a domain has been limited. Mirroring real-world problems, incomplete information games, such as card games, were utilized to investigate the influence of ‘jerk,’ denoted asADvalues (ADis the abbreviation of addictive, which means players are getting addicted to the game, and players have the tendency to repeat to play the game, implying that it is difficult to stop when the action associated with it have started), from the game-playing domain. Based on different rules designs and game complexities of several popular card games (Wakeng, Doudizhu, Winner, Big Two, Tien Len), the implications ofADvalue relative to its predecessors, theGRmeasure, and its extension (called motion in mind model) were investigated. It was discussed from the perspective of game design and game-playing experiences, where artificial intelligence (AI) agents conducted self-playing simulations and verified the findings with empirical data. The condition of play that affects players’ behavior was determined, outlined as the principle of play, and relationships between attractive and addictive games were established.",

        "abstract": "Guaranteeing end-to-end network latency bounds is required in many applications. A necessary condition for ensuring end-to-end latency bounds is to keep the total service rate for flows on each link lower than the capacity of the link. An admission control with setup messages before data transmission is necessary to check whether the total service rate remains within the capacity in each link through which the flow passes. Current practices of admission control require every node to maintain flow state information including the service rates of individual flows, which is not practical in large-scale networks with high link speeds and a massive number of flows. Instead, determining the total service rate of a link without maintaining any flow state information is highly desired. This study proposes a method to accurately infer the total service rate of the link using only packet metadata so that admission control can be performed without setup messages or state maintenance for each flow at the core node. By specifying the exact time of inference, the service rate can be inferred at a desired time. The effectiveness of the proposed method is proven through simulations. The simulation was conducted on a simple topology with four types of flows, each differing in service rate and service period.",

        "abstract": "This study proposes a multiview stereo (MVS) method that is based on the forward and backward propagation of matching costs for the incremental refinement of multiview disparity maps. The volume-based MVS method requires numerous three-dimensional (3D) memory volumes to compute, store, and process the stereo matching costs. However, owing to memory limitations, conventional MVS methods allocate the memory of the 3D cost volumes only to the reference and its neighbor views. Thus, each reference view can only use the matching costs from a limited number of neighbor views. This study addresses this inherent MVS problem and proposes a new method by employing a forward and backward cost propagation (FBCP). First, a subpart of the input views is used to obtain disparity maps with a dense MVS method. Once all matching costs of the subpart views are sufficiently refined, the FBCP is performed for a new neighbor view. Immediately after the cost volume of the new view is computed, all matching costs of the subpart are forward propagated and fused with the initial cost of the new view. Furthermore, the new fused cost is backward propagated into the subpart to refine the previous costs again using the new fused cost. All cost volumes can be incrementally computed and refined without any limitation on the number of views using the proposed FBCP scheme. In the final step, all disparity maps are obtained from the refined cost volumes and fused into single point clouds. Moreover, we propose the use of surface consensus to obtain accurate fused point clouds for the fusion of the disparity maps. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated using the fused point clouds. The proposed method achieves less than 0.5 mm in mean distance error and about 82 percentage F-score within 2 mm distance threshold value.",

In this study, we focus on the performance of deep learning (DL) models and the proposed Power Long Short-Term Memory (PLSTM) model introduced in our early research for predicting internal temperatures using a database from Spain. By analyzing DL architectures such as Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Long Short-Term Memory with Artificial Neural Network (LSTM-ANN), and Long Short-Term Memory with Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM-RNN), we aim to benchmark their performance against the proposed PLSTM model. Additionally, this study explores the correlation between internal temperature and other key environmental factors and evaluates how well the models generalize these relationships. The results show that the PLSTM model consistently outperforms the evaluated DL models, achieving an R2 of 0.9999 with a significantly lower Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) demonstrating its robustness in handling time-series forecasting for greenhouse conditions. This research underscores the potential of PLSTM as a key tool for improving precision climate control in agriculture and offers valuable insights for the development of intelligent greenhouse systems.",

Most existing person re-identification methods use the same feature descriptors and similarity metrics for all pedestrian pairs. However, these methods ignore that image pairs with different visual consistency conditions are sensitive to different features and metrics. In this paper, we propose to optimally organize multiple similarity measures of global pedestrian and body part pairs with respect to different visual consistency measures (VCM). First, we compute multiple similarity measures for global image and body parts. Then, we group the global image and body part set into three classes based on their VCM value, respectively. Finally, the VCM-specific similarity measures of pedestrian as well as body part pairs are selected and optimally organized to form an ensemble by the reliability estimation and adaptively weighting combination. This method is termed as multiple similarity ensemble based on the visual consistency measure (MSE-VCM). Our contributions are 1) the visual consistency measure method which can select the most appropriate similarity measures for image pairs and 2) optimal organization of these VCM-specific features and metrics on global image and body parts. Extensive experiments on three challenging data sets are conducted. Results demonstrate that our method achieves the comparable performance versus the state-of-the-art methods.",

Quantum computing may be invoked in the detection procedure, by exploiting its inherent parallelism for approaching the ML MUDs performance at a substantially reduced number of cost function evaluations. In this contribution, we propose a soft-output (SO) quantum-assisted MUD achieving a near-ML performance and compare it to the corresponding SO ant colony optimization MUD. We investigate rank deficient direct-sequence spreading (DSS) and slow subcarrier-hopping aided (SSCH) spatial division multiple access orthogonal frequency division multiplexing systems, where the number of users to be detected is higher than the number of receive antenna elements used. We show that for a given complexity budget, the proposed SO-Dürr-Høyer algorithm (DHA) QMUD achieves a better performance. We also propose an adaptive hybrid SO-ML/SO-DHA MUD, which adapts itself to the number of users equipped with the same spreading sequence and transmitting on the same subcarrier. Finally, we propose a DSS-based uniform SSCH scheme, which improves the system's performance by 0.5 dB at a BER of 10−5, despite reducing the complexity required by the MUDs employed.",

However, mobile users can be vulnerable to various attacks by adversaries, because the roaming services are provided through public network. Therefore, an anonymous mobile user authentication for roaming services is an essential security issue in global mobility networks. Recently, Lee et al. pointed out the security weaknesses of a previous scheme and proposed an advanced secure anonymous authentication scheme for roaming services in global mobility networks. However, we found that the scheme proposed by Lee et al. is vulnerable to password guessing and user impersonation attacks, and that it cannot provide perfect forward secrecy and secure password altered phase. In this paper, to overcome the security weaknesses of the scheme proposed by Lee et al., we propose an improved secure anonymous authentication scheme using shared secret keys between home agent and foreign agent. In addition, we analyze the security of our proposed scheme against various attacks and prove that it provides secure mutual authentication using Burrows-Abadi-Needham logic. In addition, the formal security analysis using the broadly-accepted real-or-random (ROR) random oracle model and the formal security verification using the widely accepted automated validation of the Internet security protocols and applications tool show that the proposed scheme provides the session key security and protection against replay as well as man-in-the-middle attacks, respectively.

This study introduces a novel feature embedding technique named Dynamic Weighted Tabular Method (DWTM), which dynamically uses feature weights based on their strength of the correlations to the class labels during applying any CNN architectures on the tabular datasets. DWTM converts each data point into images and then feeds to a CNN architecture. It dynamically embeds the features of the tabular dataset based on their strength and assigns pixel positions to the appropriate features in the image canvas space instead of using any static configuration. In this paper, DWTM embedding method is applied over six benchmark tabular datasets independently by using three different CNN architectures (i.e., ResNet-18, DenseNet and InceptionV1) and an outstanding performance (an average accuracy of 98%) has obtained, which outperforms any traditional and CNN based classifiers as well.",

Additionally, this results in saturation of the ferromagnetic core components. These variables cause a significant increase in voltage and/or current, as well as aberrations in the waveforms of voltage and current. The contribution of Distributed Generation (DG), to the decrease in ferroresonance investigation in the distribution zone, is discussed in this paper. A new method to reduce ferroresonance using the High Ohmic Reactor (HOR) as a Shunt Limiter (SL) is presented. It is based on the measurements of the negative-sequence components. The proposed HOR-SL reduced the ferroresonance occurrence in the Distribution System (DS) by a time value of no more than 23 milliseconds. The proposed HOR-SL method is compared with the Series Resistance (SR) and Series Tuned LC Limiter (STLCL) methods. The results obtained using the proposed HOR-SL are better than the ones obtained using SE and STLCL. In terms of the voltage and the time taken to mitigate the ferroresonance. The ferroresonance phenomenon is modelled with the help of the PSCAD/EMTDC software. The results obtained demonstrated the effectiveness of implementing the suggested HOR-SL for suppressing ferroresonant oscillations to restore the original state of stability of the distribution network. Case studies strongly proved the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method in reducing ferroresonance oscillations and maintaining the security of the electrical components in the distribution network.",

Yet, they have not become a mainstream tool in a typical programmer’s toolbox and are not typically available in intergraded development environments. So, do they really work? And if they do, what would it take to put them to work? This paper seeks to answer these two questions through experiments, surveys, and interviews. A source code history visualization tool named TeamWATCH was implemented to visualize subversion code repositories. Two comparative controlled experiments were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of TeamWATCH. The experimental results showed that the subjects using TeamWATCH spent less time than subjects using the command-line subversion client and TortoiseSVN in answering the same set of questions regarding source code revision history. In addition, surveys and interviews were conducted to identify obstacles in adopting source code history visualization tools. Collectively, the results show that source code history visualization tools do bring value to programmers. Key obstacles to wider adoption in practice include nontrivial overhead in using the tools and perceived complexity in visualization.",

        "abstract": "Quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicles have become very popular for doing numerous tasks; however, due to their small size and weight, they are very sensitive to parameter uncertainties and external disturbances. In this paper, a new robust fault-tolerant approach is introduced to track the attitude trajectory of a quadrotor in finite time that suffers from stochastic actuator faults, system parameter uncertainties, and unknown external disturbances. Furthermore, the effects of time-varying input delay are considered in the control input. Based on the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional approach, two theorems are given to derive some delay-dependent conditions regarding the design of a controller that guarantees the finite-time contractive stability of the attitude tracking error system with the prescribedH∞performance index. This means that the tracking error states converge to a defined bound within a fixed time interval which is smaller than the initial state bound, and the acceptableH∞disturbance attenuation level is achieved. Finally, the proposed method is applied to a quadrotor facing the external disturbance and stochastic actuator fault. The simulation results verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed control scheme as compared to the asymptotic stability approach and the finite-time boundedness stability model.",

        "abstract": "Robotics has come a long way from industrial robotic arms and is all set to enter our homes. The capability of a robot to navigate in an unknown human populated environment with obstacles and making map simultaneously is one of the significant characteristics in the domain of autonomous robotics. Further, the problem of robot navigating in a social environment while ensuring human safety and comfort through social norms needs to be addressed. This article presents a solution for mapping of unknown terrains with dynamic obstacles using simultaneous localization in social environments through Adaptive Squashing Function based artificial neural network training, which is able to track the target orientation angles more efficiently as compared to conventional fixed slope squashing function based backpropagation training algorithm. The performance of different state of the art techniques have been compared with proposed work through simulation models. Simulation results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in complex environment where the proposed algorithm converged in less than 50% of the iterations taken by the exhaustive search algorithms and approximately 33% of the iterations taken by random search algorithm. Further, the proposed approach was tested in the real-world settings, wherein the robot was deployed to create map for the Kalpana Chawla Center for Research in Space Science and Technology, Chandigarh University with mobile humans.",

        "abstract": "After many years of rigid conventional procedures of production, industrial manufacturing is going through a process of change toward flexible and intelligent manufacturing, the so-called Industry 4.0. In this paper, human-robot collaboration has an important role in smart factories since it contributes to the achievement of higher productivity and greater efficiency. However, this evolution means breaking with the established safety procedures as the separation of workspaces between robot and human is removed. These changes are reflected in safety standards related to industrial robotics since the last decade, and have led to the development of a wide field of research focusing on the prevention of human-robot impacts and/or the minimization of related risks or their consequences. This paper presents a review of the main safety systems that have been proposed and applied in industrial robotic environments that contribute to the achievement of safe collaborative human-robot work. Additionally, a review is provided of the current regulations along with new concepts that have been introduced in them. The discussion presented in this paper includes multidisciplinary approaches, such as techniques for estimation and the evaluation of injuries in human-robot collisions, mechanical and software devices designed to minimize the consequences of human-robot impact, impact detection systems, and strategies to prevent collisions or minimize their consequences when they occur.",

By using the properties of Gaussian functions, an approximate approach to the APP detection is devised with the idea that, in the computation of the APP of each symbol, the remaining symbols are distinguished based on their contributions to the APP of the concerned symbol, and the symbols with less contributions are approximated as (continuous) Gaussian variables [hence the name partial Gaussian approximation (PGA)] to reduce the computational complexity. The connection between the PGA detector and the reduced dimension maximum a posteriori detector (RDMAP) is investigated. It is shown that, PGA is equivalent to RDMAP, but it has a complexity much lower than that of RDMAP, i.e., PGA can be regarded as an efficient implementation of RDMAP. In addition, the application of PGA in intersymbol interference (ISI) channel equalization is also investigated. We show that PGA allows further significant complexity reduction by exploiting the circulant structure of the system transfer matrix, which makes PGA very attractive in handling severe ISI channels with large memory length.",

However, it is very difficult to generate a new recovery scheduling in a reasonable time by traditional methods, especially for large dimension airline disruption problem. To deal with this problem rapidly, the airline disruption problem will be reformulated as integer programmings and a distributed network, which is based on the fixed-point iterative method for integer programming, will be developed in this paper. In response to the airport closure, an airplane reschedule is constructed by these feasible flight lines. In the implementation of distributed network, a certain number of independent segments are obtained by dividing the solution space. As a feature of this fixed-point method, the number of partial feasible flight lines, which have to be calculated for finding an optimized airplane reschedule, is much fewer compared with the number needed by CPLEX CP Optimizer. This is the first distributed integer programming method to large airline disruption problems caused by airports closure. In the numerical results, the proposed distributed approach shows promising, especially for solving the large dimension airline disruption problem.",

This paper illustrates the systematic survey of advanced research in the field of semantic segmentation till date. This study provides the brief knowledge about the latest proposed methods in the domain of semantic segmentation. The proposed study comprehends the concepts, techniques, tool, and results of different research frameworks proposed in the context of semantic segmentation. This study discusses the latest research papers in which machine learning and deep learning techniques are exploited for semantic segmentation and published between 2016 and 2021. The systematic literature review collected from seven different article libraries including ACM digital Library, Google Scholar, IEEE Xplore, Science Direct, Google Books, Refseek and Worldwide Science. For assuring the quality of the paper those papers are selected which have several citations on standardized platforms. Most of the studies used COCO, PASCAL, Cityscapes and CamVid dataset for training and validation of the machine learning and deep learning models. The results of the selected research articles are collected in the form of accuracy, mIoU value, F1 score, precision, and recall. In this study, we also conclude that most of the semantic segmentation studies use ResNet as the backbone of the architecture and none of the researchers used ensemble learning methods for semantic segmentation that is the loophole of the selected studies.",

        "abstract": "One of the classic approaches to controlling power networks, as large-scale systems, has been the use of a centralized control architecture. This approach is currently used less frequently due to its computational complexity. Another possible approach is the use of a decentralized control architecture. However, this approach can lead to unacceptable global performance of the system due to the lack of knowledge about the available interactions among subsystems. A third approach is the application of a cooperatively distributed architecture. On the other hand, one technique that has proved to be quite efficient for the control of power system frequency is model predictive control (MPC). In this paper, the performance of cooperatively distributed MPC is compared with that of the centralized MPC and the classical automatic generation control methods. The main contribution of this paper is that the load variations are applied to the system in the form of consecutive pulses. Additionally, the disturbance levels considered here have higher values. Moreover, the range of control input variations is reduced; therefore, the constraints are chosen more strictly. Finally, the total error of the system is determined, and the discussed methods are evaluated by the newly defined indices. According to simulation results, a feasible cooperation-based MPC method leads to relatively desired performance and computational speed and so can be an appropriate practical option for controlling power systems.",

The proposed control scheme is divided into two levels. The first level employs voltage-dependent loads to modulate the frequency of the system by adjusting its voltage, thereby increasing the active power reserves of the system while accurately sharing reactive power among distributed energy resources. The second level uses the active power reserves generated by the VFC to stabilize the frequency of the system and strengthen its resistance to disruptions. Time-domain analysis is used to validate the proposed control method and compare its performance with those of the existing approaches. Furthermore, the proposed method is demonstrated via simulations in the context of a test system based on the CIGRE medium voltage benchmark under various scenarios. The results of these simulations confirm the superior performance of the new approach over that of existing control approaches.",

Soil Surface Roughness (SSR) represents a key parameter for evaluating the terrain quality structure, especially in the layers beneath the usual primary tillage depth, and therefore its estimation has been widely investigated over the years in many fields of science and engineering. This paper proposes the adoption of an innovative sensing approach that relies on contactless measurements provided by a depth camera in contrast to traditional contact measurements such as pin meter and roller chain. In addition, novel features are investigated to achieve a complete statistical description of the SSR with the least number of parameters.

        "abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of designing nonlinear discrete-time dynamical systems for prospective use in low-complexity random signal generators. Drawing upon ergodic systems theory, we derive a novel method for designing nonlinear systems with zero-input responses that simultaneously satisfy two user-specified statistical metrics as specifications. These metrics are a piecewise-constant probability density function and a power spectral density expressed as a rational function with an arbitrary number of prescribed non-repeating poles. This new method configures a memoryless nonlinearity (i.e., a map) with a low-complexity hat-like structure as a recursive system with adjustable parameters, thereby yielding a simplified and explicit relationship between the system’s parameters and the statistical metrics of its response. This yields a matrix design approach that, unlike existing methods, affords the freedom to prescribe all of the poles as a set of non-repeating complex values without resorting to a numerical search over the parameter space for a candidate solution. Simulations are presented of elementary systems constructed using the novel method, and the link between the maps’ structure and the observed statistical behavior is expounded. More sophisticated systems with richer statistical metrics are constructed as examples that demonstrate the method’s versatility. We also demonstrate the independent adjustment of the center frequency and bandwidth of power spectrum modes during system design, which affords greater freedom than existing methods to select the power spectral density. We anticipate that the proposed method will find application in the construction of efficient random signal generators for Monte Carlo simulation in domains such as mobile communications, radar engineering, data encryption and optimization.",

LEDs are a semiconductor-based illumination solution that is energy-efficient, long-lasting, and capable of meeting all application requirements for quantity of light, colour and spatial limitations. In all of the essential lighting applications, LED reliability and lifetime performance are critical. The LED luminaire’s performance may decline over time, resulting in lower light output or different colours than the required colour characteristics. The importance of LED performances in LED luminaires as a system has only lately been realised. Different LEDs are used in two commercially available LED luminaires with exact electrical and optical specifications that are exposed to accelerated working conditions. The paper outlines a method for analysing and forecasting lifetime based on lumen maintenance for light output, Duv for colour-based quantification. The xy chromaticity, spectral power distribution, scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersion spectroscopy analysis are used to detect the characteristics indicative of variations in LED light output performance with degradation. The findings imply that LED packaging and device physics are important factors in the LED luminaire’s overall lifetime performance. The work gives consumers the opportunity to see specifics about luminosity and colour-based changes as a product data-sheet, making it easier for them to choose appropriate luminaires for their needs. It also aids LED and LED luminaire makers in making appropriate design and technological adjustments, resulting in improved LED performance that is long-lasting and consistent in colour stability.",

Medical images are typically sent over the internet for easy access when diagnosing a patient. Intruders can manipulate these images during communication. Therefore, we require a method of authentication for these images that is capable of authenticating these images before diagnosis. To address these issues, a watermarking scheme has been developed within the scope of this paper. The foundation of anticipated watermarking system is Regions of Interest (ROI), using FRT to RONI, and converted into blocks; afterward, Hessenberg decomposition is applied on blocks selected by means of fuzzy logic. The binary watermark is quantized into the medical image. It has made the watermarking system non-fragil and secure.The proposed scheme’s performance is evaluated on various attack situations, including noise and scale assaults. Watermarked pictures with enhanced PSNR ranging from 56.9902 to 57.2356 have been produced using the proposed technique. In particular, we achieved high NC values of 0.9801 on applying image processing attacks. A series of tests are performed on the system to determine its sensitivity, and the results are compared to protocols. The simulation results demonstrate that the suggested solution offers a high level of security while being imperceptible and robust to various attacks.",

        "abstract": "Molecular dynamics simulations offer insights into macromolecular structures and functions through extensive time-series atomic data. Two widely used metrics for assessing these simulations are RMSD and RMSF. While RMSD measures conformational convergence, it suffers from degeneracy, where different conformations can produce identical values relative to a reference. RMSF indicates relative mobility but lacks temporal specificity. As both metrics provide only global perspectives, there is a pressing need for novel metrics to capture local flexibility with temporal resolution. We introduce GEODES, a novel complementary 3D geometrical descriptor approach, and compare its effectiveness with conventional analyses using RMSD and RMSF. Through molecular dynamics simulations of the vitamin D receptor trimeric complex, we demonstrate that GEODES significantly enhances the molecular dynamics analysis workflow, offering deeper insights into the structural dynamics and interactions of this complex. This innovative and versatile approach holds great promise for applications in drug discovery, structural biology, and bioinformatics.

        "abstract": "We first review the fundamentals of directional modulation (DM) based on frequency diverse arrays (FDA), which is capable of achieving angle-range dependent point-to-point physical layer secure communications where the phase shifters of the FDA-based DM must be optimized continuously with time by complex algorithms like genetic algorithm (GA). Thereafter, in order to overcome the time-variant drawbacks of conventional FDA-based DM, we propose a time-invariant angle-range dependent DM based on time-modulated logarithmically increasing frequency offset FDA (TDM-log-FDA). Different from the conventional FDA-based DM, where the frequency offsets are linear and determinate, the frequency offsets of TDM-log-FDA are elaborately designed as time-modulated nonlinear logarithmically increasing values guaranteeing the time-invariant characteristic of TDM-log-FDA. Additionally, an improved dot-shaped time-invariant DM based on time-modulated multicarrier frequency offset FDA (DTDM-mc-FDA) is put forward to achieve time-invariant spatial fine focusing point-to-point physical layer secure communications, where multiple carriers instead of a single carrier are transmitted through each antenna element and the corresponding frequency offsets are also time-modulated. Using GA, we obtain the optimized phase shifters for the proposed two time-invariant DMs once and for all, which reduces the realization complexity of phase shifters greatly. Besides, a new metric called secure area is proposed to evaluate the security performance of DM systems. The simulated results demonstrate that the proposed TDM-log-FDA can realize time-invariant angle-range dependent secure communications, while the proposed DTDM-mc-FDA can further enhance the security with more accurately focusing secure area despite a small penalty of complexity.",

This study focuses on nondestructive estimation of the chlorophyll content of maize using near ground multispectral data. We propose a one-dimensional convolutional neural network-gated recurrent unit (1-D-CNN-GRU). That is, it combines a 1D-CNN with strong feature expression capacity and strong memory capacity with a gated recurrent unit (GRU) neural network to estimate the chlorophyll content of maize directly from multispectral images. Furthermore, the iteratively retaining informative variables-successive projections algorithm (IRIV-SPA) is first used to select the feature wavebands from the 11 available wavebands of the two datasets in the experiment. The experimental results show that the selected feature wavebands are more accurate than the raw wavebands when using the same model; based on these feature wavebands, the 1D-CNN-GRU model has smaller errors than the other conventional models such as support vector regression (SVR) and random forest (RF), with an mean relative error (MRE) of 0.069, root mean square error (RMSE) of 3.473 on Datasets I, and an MRE of 0.108, RMSE of 7.568 on Datasets II. The real-time performance is also validated in the experiment. These investigations can provide valuable guidelines for online monitoring of chlorophyll content in maize based on near earth multispectral band data, and are also important references for the development of intelligent agricultural monitoring systems for general crops, which were tested on maize only and provided reliable results in this study.",

Because of changing orders, understanding the schedule and output is a constant challenge when using a traditional manual schedule, particularly among manufacturers that produce various products. The multiobjective optimization genetic algorithm (MOGA) is a relatively superior method of solving multiobjective optimization problems; therefore, we used a MOGA to solve flexible job-shop problems for a middle-scale screw manufacturer in Taiwan. For solving the problems of incorrect jobs assign and diversity problem of traditional genetic algorithm (GA) caused by encoding method when applying traditional GA in the flexible manufacturing environment, a refined GA was proposed. Two-phase test has performed for proposed approach, using a classical benchmark of distributed and flexible jobs-shop scheduling problem, and 80 set of work orders, the empirical results indicated that the proposed model yielded substantial savings, regardless of the total order completion time, machine retooling rate, and average machine load rate.",

Generally, the sequential implementation of both RBMs and backpropagation algorithm takes significant amount of computational time to process massive data sets. The emerging big data learning requires distributed computing for the DBNs. In this paper, we present a distributed learning paradigm for the RBMs and the backpropagation algorithm using MapReduce, a popular parallel programming model. Thus, the DBNs can be trained in a distributed way by stacking a series of distributed RBMs for pretraining and a distributed backpropagation for fine-tuning. Through validation on the benchmark data sets of various practical problems, the experimental results demonstrate that the distributed RBMs and DBNs are amenable to large-scale data with a good performance in terms of accuracy and efficiency.",

The process sorting strategy of the Root-Subtree vertical and horizontal pre-scheduling is proposed to sort the Root-Subtree processes of the same planned processing equipment in groups and load the Root-Subtree processes into the corresponding equipment queues, so as to fully explore the vertical and horizontal characteristics of the process. In order to give full play to the characteristics of the flexible equipment and realize the effective parallel processing between the processes, the flexible equipment optimal scheduling strategy of dynamically determining process is proposed to determine the final processing equipment of the process at each equipment driving moment and complete the production scheduling process from the Root-Subtree static pre-scheduling to dynamic fusion; The strategy uses the scheduling relationship between the unplanned processes and unplanned equipment to reduce the search scope of the combination scheme and improve the efficiency of the algorithm. The example tests show that FISA-DEVH has a better scheduling effect than the flexible integrated scheduling algorithm that processes the process tree with unified rules, and has universal significance for solving the flexible integrated scheduling problem.",

To address this gap, this paper presents a systematic literature review comprising 45 reports on DVL, analyzed using the PRISMA methodology. Our results include the identification of the purposes of DVL, its satellite aspects, the models proposed, and the assessments designed to evaluate the degree of DVL of people.

We extend the existing analysis for CAN to support any higher level protocol for CAN that uses periodic, sporadic, and mixed transmission of messages in the systems where some nodes implement priority queues, whereas others implement FIFO queues.

A custom simulator, designed with Webots, facilitated realistic testing environments, and comprehensive dataset with systematically varied track geometries was curated for training and evaluation. Results demonstrate the proposed framework’s ability to maintain high tracking accuracy while significantly reducing computational costs, with SVR predictions closely approximating the GA-derived benchmarks. Specifically, the GA-optimized true PID values achieved a mean error of 11.8402, while the SVR-predicted PID values had a mean error of 15.4438, with SVR attaining a recall of 86.55%.

Current research shows that social recommendations that effectively utilize user trust relationships can solve data sparsity and cold start problems common in traditional collaborative filtering algorithms. However, existing social recommendation models have focused only on direct trust relationships between users and have ignored indirect trust relationships and item correlations. To address these problems, we propose a probabilistic matrix factorization-based recommendation model based on trust relationships, interest mining, and item correlation. The proposed recommendation model considers the direct and indirect trust relationships between users, the similarities in users’ preferences for item attributes, and the correlations between items. Finally, the rating of the item is predicted by the target user and provides the target user with personalized item recommendations. We evaluate the recommendation performances of the proposed recommendation model on the FilmTrust and the CiaoDVD datasets and find that it alleviates the user’s cold start problem and provides higher recommendation accuracy and diversity than popular algorithms.",

To this end, we propose a novel attention-KAN (Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks) based deep model for transportation mode detection, which primarily consists of three modules: convolutional KAN, multi-head attention and linear KAN. By introducing learnable B-spline functions, KAN can express more abundant feature information with fewer parameters which strengthens the non-linearities modeling and interpretability. Specifically, we employ convolutional KAN, which combines the advantages of KAN and convolutional neural network (CNN) to capture the short-term temporal correlations for distinct sensor features. Then we exploit multi-head attention to effectively capture long-term temporal correlations for linked sensor features in parallel, resulting in better trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed AKTMD model outperforms the state-of-the-art TMD-BERT model among the compared baselines, achieving an accuracy of 98.12% on the SHL dataset and 95.52% on the HTC dataset, with improvements of 5.05% and 3.29% over the TMD-BERT model on each dataset.",

This paper surveys the state-of-the-art literature embedding softwarization paradigm in densely deployed radio access network (RAN). In addition, the need for energy harvesting technologies in a densified RAN is provided with the review of the state-of-the-art proposals on the interaction between softwarization and energy harvesting technology. Moreover, the role of optimization tools, such as machine learning, in future RAN with densification paradigm is stated. We have classified the available literature that balances these three pillars, namely, softwarization, energy harvesting, and optimization with densification, being a common RAN deployment trend.

However, one of the main drawbacks encountered in implementing it is its resultant high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR). Many techniques have been proposed in the literature to substantially decrease the peaks in the OFDM signal. The problem with these, however, is that their effects on other parameters are not always positive. These effects include a decrease in the bit error rate (BER), an increase in complexity, or a reduction in the bit rate. The objective of this paper is to describe the PAPR problem in a bid to reduce the peaks in the OFDM signal. The paper proposes a classification, performance evaluation and optimization of PAPR reduction techniques for commercial, public safety, and tactical applications. In the taxonomy proposed herein, we also include a new category, namely, hybrid techniques. Furthermore, we compare the principal characteristics through a complementary cumulative distribution function and BER evaluation, and conclude on the importance of hybrid techniques, when the goal is to both improve the BER and reduce the PAPR.",

The two investigated SSRCF are the adaptations, for the implementation ofb+dRSCT, of the better-known canonical forms controller (constructibility) and observer (controllability). Constructibility is the implementation form actually used for convolutional transducers in TCs. This paper shows that anyb+1RSCTcan be implemented in a unique SSRCF observer. As a result, we build a function,ξ:H→G, which has as definition domain the set of encoders in SSRCF constructibility, denoted byH, and as codomain a subset of encoders in SSRCF observer, denoted byG. By proving the noninjectivity and nonsurjectivity properties of the functionξ, we prove thatHis redundant and incomplete in comparison withG, i.e., the SSRCF observer is more efficient than the SSRCF constructibility for the implementation ofb+1RSCT. We show that the redundancy of the setHis dependent on the memorymand on the number of inputsbof the consideredb+1RSCT.

        "abstract": "Big-data is a challenging domain for high-throughput digital signal processing (DSP), especially in global-projects like the square kilometer array. The composite input data rate for correlator in this system is more than 11 Tb/s, which immensely increases the memory requirement, complexity of correlation implementation and the overall power dissipation. This paper is focused on computational minimization as well as the improvement of energy efficiency in the complex architectural X-part of an FX correlator employed in large array radio telescopes. A dedicated correlator-multiplier block termed, correlator-system-multiplier-and-accumulator (CoSMAC) cell architecture is proposed, which produces two 16-b integer complex multiplications within the same clock period. The novel hardware optimization is achieved by utilizing the flipped mirror relationship (conjugate complex symmetry) between discrete Fourier transform (DFT) samples owing to the symmetry and periodicity of the DFT coefficient vectors (twiddle factors). In addition, using the proposed CoSMAC architecture a new processing element (PE) is designed to calculate both the cross- and auto-correlation functions within the same clock period. This paper describes how the arithmetic processing of three baseline calculations will be minimized in the X-part using the proposed novel algorithm and hardware design (CoSMAC and PE). In addition to optimizing the core processing elements, it is possible to eliminate nearly 50% of the usual memory requirement. The design has been synthesized using global foundries 28-nm HPP CMOS standard cells.",

        "abstract": "Hand gesture recognition is a key aspect of Human Computer Interaction (HCI), that enables recognition of hand movements or gestures through sensors and cameras. Surface Electromyography (sEMG) is a technique used to measure electrical signals generated by human muscle activity. Analyzing sEMG signals are highly influenced by the factors like electrode placement, muscle contraction patterns etc. Existing methodologies for detecting sEMG signals face challenges in interpreting signals and frequency feature variations, primarily due to factors such as noise and motion artifacts, which significantly limit the accuracy and reliability when applied to large sEMG datasets. To overcome these challenges, a cutting-edge deep learning framework is proposed, combining a convolutional autoencoder with a stacking ensemble method that integrates CNN and LSTM models, optimized through particle swarm optimization to fine-tune the hyperparameters for superior training performance. Further to reduce the prediction error, the model employs a Meta classifier technique which incorporates Random Forests approach for improved accuracy. It is evaluated on the NinaPro DB1 dataset with 27 gestures from 52 subjects and a window length of 500 ms. It achieves high accuracy of 85% and effectively mitigates the impact of erroneous data patterns for advancing the robustness of gesture recognition systems.",

        "abstract": "The traditional concept of e-commerce has gradually shifted to social commerce due to the faster integration of social media into the traditional e-commerce environment. The understanding of the determinants and reasons accounting for the acceptance of social commerce among the people is critical to practitioners and scholars alike to properly implement social media strategies to drive up social commerce purchases. This study thus examined the intention to purchase in social commerce among Chinese citizens based on the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and Social Exchange Theory (SET). The data (632 valid responses) generated through a research questionnaire was analyzed by the use of structural equation modeling (SEM) aided by AMOS statistical software. The results indicate that trusting beliefs such as trust in social networks, the integrity of the seller, and the benevolence of the seller were significant predictors of the intention to engage in social commerce purchase intention. However, the competency of the seller was not a significant determinant of the intention to purchase in social commerce. Other results showed that the consumer experience in social commerce was significant in predicting the trust in social networks, the integrity of the seller, the competency of the seller, and the benevolence of the seller in social commerce interaction. The validations of the significant impact of consumer experience on the four-trusting belief factors (trust in social networks, the integrity of the seller, competency of the seller, and benevolence of the seller) are among the major contributions of this study to the e-commerce and social commerce literature. Practical and research implications are discussed.",

By folding the edge of the radiating patch with loading slots, the size of the patch antenna is 44.8% smaller than a conventional half wavelength patch, which allows it to be accommodated inside handsets easily. Wide beamwidth is obtained by surrounding the patch with a dielectric substrate and supporting the antenna by a metallic block. A measured half power beamwidth of 124° is achieved. The impedance bandwidth of the antenna is over 10%, and the 3-dB axial ratio bandwidth is 3.05%. The proposed antenna covers a wide elevation angle and complete azimuth range.

However, current methods for early cancer detection still lack sufficient sensitivity and specificity. In this study, we developed an interpretable machine learning (ML) model for HCC prediction using miRNA-seq data from TCGA-LIHC. Five feature selection algorithms and 11 classifiers were employed to identify key miRNAs for HCC diagnosis, with the Sarsa-CatBoost combination yielding the best performance, achieving an accuracy of 96.0%, a matthews correlation coefficient of 89.2%, and an AUC of 97.6%. Three interpretability techniques—permutation feature importance, Partial Dependence Plots (PDP), and Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP)—were integrated into the pipeline to enhance model transparency. Both permutation feature importance and SHAP analysis identified hsa-miR-93 and hsa-miR-139 as key miRNAs for HCC prediction. SHAP and PDP further revealed how these miRNAs influence HCC development and their potential synergistic interactions. Subsequently, survival analysis, target prediction, and enrichment analysis were performed to assess the biological significance of these miRNAs. The enrichment analysis suggested that these miRNAs may be implicated in the onset and progression of HCC. These miRNAs hold promise as potential biomarkers for HCC diagnosis and prognosis, warranting further investigation into their mechanistic roles and clinical applicability.",

        "abstract": "We propose a flow table management scheme for OpenFlow switches to minimize table-miss in a flow table. Commercial OpenFlow switches have one or more flow tables that consist of flow entries for processing packets. However, flow entries are managed based only on their timeout parameters, meaning they are expired and deleted by switches regardless of their reusability. The absence of the flow entry then causes table-misses in the future. We propose a solution for the problem of switches disregarding vacancies in the flow table when deleting expired flow entries. When a table-miss occurs, the corresponding switch must perform additional interactions with an OpenFlow controller to insert new flow entries, but this results in additional processing time and communication overhead. Previous studies aimed at solving this limitation have used sophisticated training sets or modified network architectures. In contrast, we propose a simple flow table management scheme with a least recently used-based caching algorithm to keep flow entries in an OpenFlow switch as long as possible. For this purpose, the switch continually adjusts its cache size according to the vacancy of each flow table and the controller determines the packet forwarding path through the switches by referring to the vacancies. We perform an experimental evaluation of the proposed scheme and demonstrate the performance gains in terms of the number of table-missed packets. We also analyze the effectiveness of the flow entry caching scheme using a mathematical model.",

In order to effectively fuse the data of the camera and LiDAR attached to different positions and angles, we must perform camera–LiDAR extrinsic calibration. Most existing camera–LiDAR calibration methods infer the results by constructing a camera–LiDAR feature pair using features acquired from a single frame. It has the disadvantage that it is challenging to draw results. In this paper, we used sequential LiDAR data to extract features by accumulating LiDAR frames effectively. By using the location information between the accumulated frame (global) and the single frame (local) to convert the features detected from the global to the local, the shortcomings of LiDAR’s single frame with few features were supplemented. Methods for detecting feature points in LiDAR are described step-by-step, and the advantages and excellence of this camera–LiDAR calibration system are shown through quantitative/qualitative evaluation methods. As a result, the proposed system outputs superior performance compared to other systems.",

Existing curriculum design methodologies often assume that educators possess prior knowledge and experience in curriculum development. However, these frameworks do not account for Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) who, with limited or no curriculum design experience, seek to develop online courses. Furthermore, current methodologies lack a learner-centered process model that is agile and responsive to external changes. With their inherent flexibility and adaptability, Agile methodologies offer potential solutions by allowing for quick adaptation to shifting educational environments. This paper introduces Agile Online Course Curriculum Design (AOCCD). This framework empowers SMEs to create learner-centered online curricula through iterative development cycles incorporating continuous learner feedback. The AOCCD was validated through a mixed-method study in which 12 SMEs applied this approach to develop their online course curricula, assessing its utility and effectiveness. Results demonstrate that AOCCD enables SMEs, regardless of prior curriculum experience, to create well-structured and scaffolded learner-centered courses, addressing the need for structure and responsiveness in online education design.",

Certain successful algorithms, such as LTL2BA and SPOT, first translate an LTL formula into a transition-based generalized Büchi automaton (TGBA) and then degeneralize it into a Büchi automaton. This paper focuses on achieving a better translation from LTL to TGBA and analyzing the performance of every step of the algorithm. We decompose the translation into three steps to give a step-wise description and improve all three steps. The first step is the basic translation without acceptance conditions and simplifications, which combines the advantages of both LTL2BA and SPOT. Second, we introduce a new definition of acceptance conditions. Our proofs and experiments have shown that our technique is more efficient and improves the degeneralization ability. Finally, we introduce the simplifications of our algorithm. We focus on not only producing better final Büchi automata but also minimizing intermediate automata, which can reduce the execution time.",

In order to accurately increase learning features to the low- and high-resolution image pairs, we proposed a gradient degradation model of terahertz(THz) images to describe the process of a high-resolution THz image’s gradient map is how degraded to corresponding low-resolution THz image’s gradient map. And with the proposed model, we presented a low- and high-resolution THz image pair construction method with gradient fusion for learning-based super-resolution. As gradient maps are fused to training pairs, performance of learning-based super-resolution methods for THz images could be improved. In addition, we applied the low- and high-resolution THz image pair construction method with gradient fusion to very deep super-resolution(VDSR) method and zero shot super-resolution(ZSSR) method, named VDSR method with gradient fusion and ZSSR method with gradient fusion, respectively. To evaluate the performance of these two improved methods, comparison experiments with passive millimeter-wave images and our THz lab data are presented. The experimental results show that the performance of the VDSR method with gradient fusion and the ZSSR method with gradient fusion have significant improvements in peak signal-to-noise ratio and structural similarity index measure than the VDSR method and the ZSSR method, respectively.

However, they introduce challenges such as voltage inversion, harmonic distortion, and nonlinear dynamics, complicating fault diagnosis in contemporary power systems. This study introduces an innovative method to analyze the waveforms of fault signals, utilizing advances in Internet and sensor technologies that provide extensive voltage and current data in a time-series form. By optimizing each phase of data processing from feature extraction to model learning, the proposed system effectively addresses fault detection, classification, and localization as a multi-classification problem. The integration of feature extraction with efficient gradient-boosting feature selection ensures high accuracy, speed, and computational efficiency, thus outperforming techniques that require heavy preprocessing. The methodology is implemented using four ensemble classifiers: Adaptive Boosting (AB), Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM), Random Forest (RF), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), and is rigorously evaluated on various standard models of differing complexity and system configurations under dynamic conditions. This approach achieves high accuracy, adaptability, and robustness, overcoming practical constraints, such as high noise immunity, resource efficiency, and scalability for real-world applications. The results showed that RF achieved the highest accuracy of 99.94%, whereas XGB exhibited the fastest computational time of 0.2790 s for binary classification.

A quantum channel is PD if the channel output can be used to simulate the degraded environment state. The PD channels could exist both in the degradable, antidegradable and conjugate degradable family. We define the term partial simulation, which is a clear benefit that arises from the structure of the complementary channel of a PD channel. We prove that the quantum capacity of an arbitrary dimensional PD channel is additive. We also demonstrate that better quantum data rates can be achieved over a PD channel in comparison with standard (non-PD) channels.

We propose an automatic coding method for the Flanders Interaction Analysis (FIA) classroom observation record form (CORF) by integrating various artificial intelligence technologies to tackle these issues. Initially, audio is extracted from recorded classroom videos to isolate the speech of both teachers and students. Next, we employ the Paraformer model for speaker separation and speech recognition, converting the extracted audio into corresponding text and timestamp information for each speaker. Simultaneously, a pre-trained BERT module is fine-tuned on all spoken text. Finally, this fine-tuned BERT model is used to classify the text into ten distinct categories of interaction behavior, effectively generating the coding necessary for the CORF of FIA. Experimental results reveal that our proposed method achieves an accuracy of 94.63% in speaker separation, 95.32% in speech recognition, and 87.95% in agreement with manual annotations during speech behavior analysis. These findings indicate that our method is highly effective for automating the coding process of the CORF for the FIA system.",

        "abstract": "Workload prediction is one of the most basic requirements in developing cost and energy-efficient Cloud Data Centers (CDCs). Most traditional approaches have suffered from noise and failed to capture the complex dynamic patterns in workload data, reducing their accuracy. To improve this, we introduce CVCBM which blends signal processing techniques Complete Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition with Adaptive Noise (CEEMDAN) and Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) with advanced deep learning models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) networks. CVCBM utilizes a hierarchical two-stage decomposition process, beginning with CEEMDAN. We use the capability of CEEMDAN for denoising by additive white noise to clean the noisy workload data and further decompose it into several Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs), ranging from high to low frequencies. Then, we propose a partitional clustering approach based on Sample Entropy (SE) to select components of similar complexity to increase the effectiveness of the second-stage denoising. After that, VMD is a method based on the center frequency applied to decompose further the high-frequency components, which may contain fluctuations that obscure underlying trends, thus enhancing the model’s overall accuracy. A novel hybrid model is utilized to forecast future workloads, incorporating two sets of three distinct parallel Conv1D layers with varying kernel sizes. These layers extract patterns from the input data, capturing short-term, medium-term, and long-term workload information, allowing the model to learn variations at different scales. Following this, Bi-LSTM layers capture the temporal dependencies within the patterns identified by the Conv1D layers. Extensive experiments on various real-world datasets from Google and Alibaba show that CVCBM significantly outperforms the other methods, which makes it a solution for future workload prediction in cloud data centers.",

They infiltrate highly secure networks using air-gap jumping capability (e.g., “Hammer Drill”and “Brutal Kangaroo”) and spread through heterogeneous computing and communication platforms. Some of these cross-platform malware attacks are capable of infiltrating isolated control systems which might be running a variety of operating systems, such as Windows, Mac OS X, Solaris, and Linux. This paper investigates cross-platform/heterogeneous mobile malware that uses removable media, such as USB connection, to spread between incompatible computing platforms and operating systems. Deep analysis and modeling of cross-platform mobile malware are conducted at the micro (infection) and macro (spread) levels. The micro-level analysis aims to understand the cross-platform malware states and transitions between these states during node-to-node infection. The micro-level analysis helps derive the parameters essential for macro-level analysis, which are also crucial for the elaboration of suitable detection and prevention solutions. The macro-level analysis aims to identify the most important factors affecting cross-platform mobile malware spread within a digitized population.

A number of approaches are used to overcome these limitations. However, each approach has its gaps, such as complexity, parameter tuning sensitivity, dependence on initial image quality and long computational time. Furthermore, most methods may perform poorly well on images with different types. This paper proposes a new modified version of CLAHE, called Contrast Limited Adaptive Local Histogram Equalization (CLALHE), to address its limitations. This method is designed to enhance image contrast locally and adaptively, without the need for user input. The CLALHE approach consists of several steps: First, multiple enhancements are applied to identify the optimal enhancement parameters. Second, these parameters are determined adaptively. Third, the original image is divided into subimages, and the optimal parameters are applied to each subimage independently, emphasizing and enhancing local features. Finally, the enhanced subimages are combined to produce the resulting image. The effects of local and adaptive concepts were systematically explored to identify the optimal parameters and validate the performance using three datasets (DIARETDB1, Pasadena-Houses 2000 and Faces 1999). Qualitative assessments demonstrated the excellent performance of CLALHE and showcased enhanced images with improved contrast, better-defined details and less time consumption. Quantitative evaluation further confirmed the efficacy of CLALHE, which surpasses other methods in terms of peak signal-to-noise ratio, entropy, absolute mean brightness error, structure similarity index, contrast improvement index an...",

        "abstract": "Multilayer neural network-based model predictive control (MLNN-MPC) has received a lot of attention in different power electronic applications. However, the computational burden often imposes limitations in low-order DSPs especially if a large number of voltage vectors (VVs) are used. The execution time of MLNN-MPC in low-order DSPs is affected heavily by the number of input, output, neurons in the hidden layer, and the type of activation function. Furthermore, MLNN contains many parameters that needed to be optimized, such as initial weights, number of iterations, and number of neurons. Therefore, in this study, a creative single-layer neural network-based model predictive control with discrete space vector PWM (SLNN-MPC-DSVPWM) is proposed to overcome these limitations. The main advantages of the proposed method include easy implementation on low-order DSPs, better performance compared with MLNN-MPC, allowing the use of a large number of VVs, and no initialization of lookup tables for all VVs. The proposed SLNN is trained using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm and results in an execution time of only8μscompared with the complexity of the conventional MPC-DSVPWM and recent MLNN-MPC methods. The SLNN-MPC-DSVPWM is validated by both simulation and experimental results for permanent magnet synchronous motors.",

        "abstract": "In the era of big data, reduced models capable of reducing big data graph to estimate personalized PageRank are limited. Personalized PageRank is a page rank calculation where random jumps are only allowed to a subset of start nodes. The resources of current process of calculation of personalized PageRank are highly prohibitive, thus in this paper we propose a novel fast accurate and less resource intensive algorithm to the personalized PageRank problem. FAST Personalized PageRank is utilized to find the target node set. Using the mentioned target set, the algorithm gives an estimation of the closeness of any pair of nodes in the graph. As the time taken by the estimation of personalized PageRank is directly proportional to the network size, in this paper a node reduction method is used to prune the graph. In this pruning model, most popular nodes also known as hubs are found using personalized page vector. To decrease the entropy and reduce the number of alternate paths to the target nodes, popular nodes are identified and flagged. The flagged nodes are, then, given a lower priority in the computation. This way the redundant path will being ignored in the computation process. After pruning the graph, estimation results achieve an improved time complexity. In our experiment, we compare our result with the benchmark FAST personalized PageRank approach. Our algorithm significantly reduces the computation time and outperforms the benchmark FAST personalized PageRank algorithm in highly dense graphs.",

The SP system—introduced in this paper and fully described elsewhere—may help to overcome the problem of variety in big data; it has potential as a universal framework for the representation and processing of diverse kinds of knowledge, helping to reduce the diversity of formalisms and formats for knowledge, and the different ways in which they are processed. It has strengths in the unsupervised learning or discovery of structure in data, in pattern recognition, in the parsing and production of natural language, in several kinds of reasoning, and more. It lends itself to the analysis of streaming data, helping to overcome the problem of velocity in big data. Central in the workings of the system is lossless compression of information: making big data smaller and reducing problems of storage and management. There is potential for substantial economies in the transmission of data, for big cuts in the use of energy in computing, for faster processing, and for smaller and lighter computers. The system provides a handle on the problem of veracity in big data, with potential to assist in the management of errors and uncertainties in data. It lends itself to the visualization of knowledge structures and inferential processes. A high-parallel, open-source version of the SP machine would provide a means for researchers everywhere to explore what can be done with the system and to create new versions of it.",

The proposed adaptive OFDM VLC system supports both repetition coding (RC) and spatial multiplexing (SM) as MIMO modes and allows spatial mode switching based on channel conditions. Regarding to the instantaneous signal-to-noise ratio for both RC and SM modes, the maximum constellation size that can be supported for each MIMO mode on each subcarrier is determined. The MIMO mode that gives the highest spectral efficiency (SE) is then selected. The proposed joint MIMO mode selection and bit loading scheme maximizes the SE while satisfying a target bit error rate. Our numerical results reveal that a peak data rate up to 18.3 Gb/sec can be achieved in a 16 × 16 MIMO setting using light emitting diodes with cut-off frequency of 10 MHz in typical indoor environments.",

This is challenging because network traffic data exhibits complex nonlinear spatiotemporal interactions. Moreover, the data can have missing values when traffic statistic collection is unavailable in certain nodes. In this paper, we introduce a graph Gaussian Process (GP) model for this challenging problem. The GP is a Bayesian non-parametric model and highly flexible in capturing complex patterns in the data. Additionally, it provides uncertainty information which can be exploited for robust resource allocation problems. The developed graph GP model is almost free of hyper-parameter tuning, can accurately capture short-term and long-term temporal patterns and can infer missing values by learning spatiotemporal interactions among the nodes in the network. Subsequently, we approximate the intractable posterior distribution using Variational Bayes (VB) algorithm which can be efficiently implemented. Finally, we evaluate the accuracy of the proposed model for predicting the data traffic using two real-world network datasets. Our simulation results shows that the proposed model can achieve better prediction accuracy with respect to the state-of-the-art approaches.",

This problem has been studied widely from different angles and many methods have been proposed for designing good practical signal constellations. There has been a rejuvenated interest in designing good constellations during last decade, in part due to the advent of novel optimization techniques. Nevertheless, most of the recent work, similar to the older work in this area, aims to optimize the constellation within a presumed structure (such as points lying on concentric rings). In this paper, we develop a different approach: we aim to optimize constellations based on a Chernoff bound on the probability of error in the versatile Nakagami-m fading channel. We derive two general bounds on the symbol error rate and bit error rate performance of orthogonal transmission in a Nakagami-m fading channel for single-input single-output and orthogonal space-time block codes and we show that a substantial improvement in the error probability is achieved with the novel constellations that are optimized using these bounds.",

We model eye and head as a sphere, or ellipsoid, rotating about its center, or about its south pole, where the axes of rotation are physiologically constrained, as was proposed originally by Listing and Donders. The Donders' constraint is either derived from Fick gimbals or from observed rotation data of adult human head. The movement dynamics is derived onSO(3)or on a suitable submanifold ofSO(3)after describing a Lagrangian. Using two forms of parametrization, the axis-angle and Tait– Bryan, the motion dynamics is described as an Euler– Lagrange's equation, which is written together with an externally applied control torque. Using the control system, so obtained, we propose a class of optimal control problem that minimizes the norm of the applied external torque vector. Our control objective is to point the eye or head, toward a stationary point target, also called the regulation problem. The optimal control problem has also been analyzed by writing the dynamical system as a Newton– Euler's equation using angular velocity as part of the state variables. In this approach, explicit parametrization ofSO(3)is not required. Finally, in the appendix, we describe a recently introduced potential control problem to address the regulation problem.",

        "abstract": "Bayesian filters exemplified by the celebrated Kalman Filter (KF), and its non-linear variants rely on a fairly accurate state-space model of the system under study. To address the issue of modelling uncertainty in state estimation, the Smooth Variable Structure Filter (SVSF) was proposed in 2007. Since then, several SVSF variants have been proposed to extend its domain of applicability. In some of these algorithms, SVSF has been viewed as a complementary approach alongside the well-established nonlinear Kalman Filters. This paper seeks a general framework for SVSF formulation to unify some of the recent developments in SVSF literature under one umbrella. In this way, the SVSF variants are revisited as special cases of the proposed framework. This paper proposes a new strategy to combine SVSF filters with other nonlinear filters and puts existing SVSF filters under one umbrella. Six filters are formulated based on the proposed method of combining filters. The proposed filters relax limitations of existing SVSF variants, making the proposed filters more universal. In simulations, the new filters outperform state-of-the-art nonlinear KFs and some existing SVSF filters. To demonstrate the merits of the proposed framework, the new filters are applied to target tracking and are comparatively evaluated.",

It has been the foundation of numerous recent studies on cache replacement policies, and most studies assume this as an upper limit. Despite its widespread adoption, we discovered opportunities to unleash the headroom by addressing cache access types and implementing cache bypass. In this study, we propose Stormbird, a cache replacement policy that synergistically integrates the extensions of Belady’s algorithm and the power of reinforcement learning. Reinforcement learning is well-suited for cache replacement policy problems owing to its ability to interact dynamically with the environment, adapt to changing access patterns, and optimize the maximum cumulative rewards. Stormbird utilizes several selected features from the reinforcement learning model to enhance the instructions per cycle efficiency while maintaining a low hardware area overhead. Furthermore, it considers cache access types and integrates dynamic set dueling techniques to improve the cache performance. For 2 MB last-level cache per core, Stormbird achieves an average instructions per cycle improvement of 0.13% over the previous state-of-the-art on a single-core system and 0.02% on a four-core system while simultaneously reducing hardware overhead by 62.5%. Stormbird incurs a low hardware overhead of only 10.5 KB for 2 MB last-level cache and can be implemented without using program counter values.",

        "abstract": "In networked control system, such as WirelessHART that is characterized by stochastic delay, the use of proportional integral and differential (PID) controllers is inadequate. This is because PID performs poorly in handling time-delay processes. The main reason for this poor performance is the limitation in the range of stable gain of the controller. Time delay causes oscillatory response of the PID with large gain. Likewise, sluggish response is experienced with small gain of the PID. Also, dead time compensators like smith predictor and internal model controller are difficult to be implemented practically since they require exact model of the process to be controlled. Therefore, this paper proposes the application of setpoint weighting strategy to be used alongside PID controller in a WirelessHART network. This method extends significantly the range of the PID gain, while providing good set point tracking and load regulation. From the simulation and experimental results obtained, the capability of the approach to load regulation and tracking can be seen in its fast recovery from effect of disturbance with minimal overshoot. Thus, a two degree of freedom control is achieved. Results also showed that the method is robust to real-time random variable network delay and model mismatches.",

In our approach, we consider two clusters of salient and non-salient context vectors, using which the decoder can attend more over salient context vectors for summary generation. For this, we propose a novel cluster generator layer between the encoder and the decoder, which first generates two clusters of salient and non-salient vectors, and then normalizes and shrinks the clusters to make them apart in the latent space. Our experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art models such as BART and PEGASUS by learning these distinct cluster patterns, improving up to 2~30% in ROUGE and 0.1~0.8% in BERTScore in CNN/DailyMail and XSUM data sets.",

To you, the basic principle of active sensing is quite clear—first absorb, then, if there is no movement or sound, shake it, and then reabsorb. We propose an extremely basic hypothesis for the active sensing of haptic interaction with dynamical systems. Our hypothesis asserts that in order to improve the efficiency of extracting information from a probed system, the sensor should act according to the following basic principle: if the probed system is passive, the sensor should be active; conversely, when the probed system is active, the sensor should be passive. We proved the proposed principle for interaction with a second-order mechanical system with the goal to enhance classification performance between two possible sine power sources. We showed that the addition of an active power source to a passive testing sensor leads to decreased sensitivity in the amplitude and frequency of the tested power source. Further, an extension of this principle is provided, presenting the conditions for reduced sensitivity to spring and damper parameters. To test its applicability for a linear system in a noisy environment, a computer simulation was performed demonstrating that classification performance improved by following the proposed principle. At last, ten subjects probed an active virtual system under either active or passive conditions. A comparison of the mean just-noticeable difference of both conditions indicated significantly better sensitivity was obtained by following the principle.",

However, there is a limitation in current deep learning based ATR solution that each learning process only handles one SAR image, namely learning the static scattering information, while missing the space-varying information. It is obvious that space-varying scattering information introduced in the multi-aspect joint recognition should improve the classification accuracy and robustness. In this paper, a novel multi-aspect-aware method is proposed to achieve this idea through the bidirectional long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networksbased space-varying scattering information learning. Specifically, we first select different aspect images to generate the multi-aspect space-varying image sequences. Then, the Gabor filter and three-patch local binary pattern are progressively implemented to extract comprehensive spatial features, followed by dimensionality reduction with the multi-layer perceptron network. Finally, we design a bidirectional LSTM recurrent neural network to learn the multi-aspect features with further integrating the softmax classifier to achieve target recognition. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve 99.9% accuracy for 10-class recognition.

Specifically, we incorporate the multiple choice learning scheme into the two-tower neural network which is a popular recommendation model that consists of two towers - one for users and one for items. In our proposed framework, we construct two encoders. One of the two encoders, the tightly-coupled encoder, focuses on the side information of items with which the user has interacted, the other one, loosely-coupled encoder, focuses the user’s interaction information. We utilize Gumbel-Softmax to stochastically select the encoder, enhancing the flexibility that considers not only item feature but also user interaction information. We evaluate our proposed framework on two datasets - the MLIMDb dataset which is a combination of widely used the MovieLens and IMDb datasets based on common movies, and the CiteULike dataset. The experimental results show that our proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art results on cold-start recommendation. In the Recall@150 experiments on the CiteULike dataset, we achieved improvement of approximately 2.7% compared to the base model. In the Recall@150 experiments on the MLIMDb dataset, we achieved improvement of approximately 5.2% compared to the base model. We further show our proposed model improves the performance in the warm-start settings. In the Recall@100 experiments on the Citeulike dataset, we observed an improvement of approximately 1.3...",

Recently, depth cameras have been affordable and widely used in daily life. However, the captured depth map always owns low resolution and poor quality, which limits its practical application. This paper proposes a color-guided depth map super resolution method using convolutional neural network. First, a dual-stream convolutional neural network, which integrates the color and depth information simultaneously, is proposed for depth map super resolution. Then, the optimized edge map generated by the high resolution color image and low resolution depth map is used as additional information to refine the object boundary in the depth map. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method compared with the state-of-the-art methods.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a hybrid gate-level leakage model for the use with the Monte Carlo (MC) analysis approach, which combines a lookup table (LUT) model with a first-order exponential-polynomial model (first-order model, herein). For the process parameters having strong nonlinear relationships with the logarithm of leakage current, the proposed model uses the LUT approach for the sake of modeling accuracy. For the other process parameters, it uses the first-order model for increased efficiency. During the library characterization for each type of logic gates, the proposed approach determines the process parameters for which it will use the LUT model. And, it determines the number of LUT data points, which can maximize analysis efficiency with acceptable accuracy, based on the user-defined threshold. The proposed model was implemented for gate-level MC leakage analysis using three graphic processing units. In experiments, the proposed approach exhibited the average errors of ¡5% in both mean and standard deviation with reference to SPICE-level MC leakage analysis. In comparison, MC analysis with the first-order model exhibited more than 90% errors. In CPU times, the proposed hybrid approach took only two to five times longer runtimes. In comparison with the full LUT model, the proposed hybrid model was up to one hundred times faster while increasing the average errors by only 3%. Finally, the proposed approach completed a leakage analysis of an OpenSparc T2 core of 4.5 million gates with a runtime of .",

Our method employs a hierarchical hypersphere-based constraint that organizes weight vectors hierarchically based on observed data. By diversifying the parameter space of hyperplanes in the classification layer, we aim to encourage discriminative generalization. We introduce a self-supervised grouping method designed to unveil hierarchical structures in scenarios with unknown hierarchy information. To maximize distances between weight vectors on multiple hyperspheres, we propose a novel metric that combines discrete and continuous measures. This regularization encourages diverse orientations, consequently leading to improved generalization. Extensive evaluations on datasets, including CUB200-2011, Stanford-Cars, CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet, consistently demonstrate enhancements in classification performance compared to baseline settings.",

        "abstract": "Numerous earlier studies focused on the term weighting scheme to increase examination question classification accuracy based on Bloom’s Taxonomy (BT). While determining the cognitive level of the examination question, all the terms present in the question are not equally significant. Verbs are the most important parts of speech while assigning weights to the terms. However, two types of verbs may be present in the questions: BT and supporting. BT verbs have a higher impact on determining the cognitive level of a question than supporting verbs. Nevertheless, the proposed schemes of past studies assigned equal weight to both types of verbs. Therefore, this study aims to introduce the term weighting scheme ETFPOS-IDF, which assigns BT a higher weight than supporting verbs. The BT verbs were identified based on their position in the questions. Three datasets and three classifiers: Support Vector Machine, Artificial Neural Network, and Random Forest, were used in this study. Two evaluation metrics: accuracy and F1 score, were used to evaluate the performance of the proposed model. The experiment results showed that the proposed ETFPOS-IDF outperformed all the schemes introduced by earlier studies in examination question classification and achieved 0.749 in accuracy and 0.746 in F1 score. The finding of this study demonstrates that distinguishing between different verb types is significant in reducing the misclassification of examination questions. This research contributed by introducing a novel term weighting scheme in classifying examination questions based on BT. Future work may involve identifying the optimal weight for both types of verbs, evaluating the proposed scheme with a larger dataset, and comparing the performance with deep learning.",

The method is validated by successful estimation of sludge volume in oil tanks using simulated and real data. First, as a demonstration of the conventional system, image reconstruction algorithms are used for tank-bottom sludge profile imaging for symmetrical and asymmetrical sludge profiles, where the setup is modeled in finite difference time domain method with reduced dimensions of the tank. A 3-D imaging algorithm is used for the 3-D simulation of real life targets. To get the volume of the sludge, ASIN-based UWB radar system is then applied and its effectiveness is demonstrated. In this framework, to get information about the sludge at the bottom of industrial tank, first, a scheme is proposed to differentiate between two sets of data which correspond to two different set of volumes. This method is validated using a commercial UWB kit, in which, practical experiments were performed. The data obtained is visualized using multidimensional scaling procedure and analyzed. Then, regression analysis using radial basis function artificial neuron network is performed, so that given a particular data, it can be predicted that, to which volume it best corresponds.",

This path of technological evolution has naturally led to a critical issue that has only started to be addressed recently: the resistance of this rapidly emerging technology to external attacks and, in particular, to spoofing. Spoofing, referred to by the term presentation attack in current standards, is a purely biometric vulnerability that is not shared with other IT security solutions. It refers to the ability to fool a biometric system into recognizing an illegitimate user as a genuine one by means of presenting a synthetic forged version of the original biometric trait to the sensor. The entire biometric community, including researchers, developers, standardizing bodies, and vendors, has thrown itself into the challenging task of proposing and developing efficient protection methods against this threat. The goal of this paper is to provide a comprehensive overview on the work that has been carried out over the last decade in the emerging field of antispoofing, with special attention to the mature and largely deployed face modality. The work covers theories, methodologies, state-of-the-art techniques, and evaluation databases and also aims at providing an outlook into the future of this very active field of research.",

This task involves dual changes of contents and geometric structures to the source image, and the target distribution is a transitional distribution, that cannot be solved by existing solutions. We propose a new CycleGAN-based scheme that extends the transformation of two image domains to that of three domains. We adopt a two-stage generation strategy in the forward transformation and urge the generator of the first stage to learn the target distribution. To this end, we set up a discriminator for the generator to guide its generation. We also present a multiple contrastive training strategy to address the problem of difficulty in training the discriminator, because there is no way to obtain real samples from the target domain. The experimental results show that our scheme is effective and that the target generator can produce intermediate images that meet the requirements.",

        "abstract": "For three decades, sudden acceleration (SA) incidents have been reported, where automobiles accelerate without warning. These incidents are often diagnosed as no fault found. Investigators, who follow the line of diagnostic reasoning from the 1989 National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) SA report, tend to conclude that SAs are caused by driver pedal error. This paper reviews the diagnostic process in the NHTSA report and finds that: 1) it assumes that an intermittent electronic malfunction should be reproducible either through in-vehicle or laboratory bench tests without saying why and 2) the consequence of this assumption, for which there appears to be no forensic precedent, is to recategorize possible intermittent electronic failures as proven to be nonelectronic. Showing that the supposedly inescapable conclusions of the NHTSA report concerning electronic malfunctions are without foundation opens the way for this paper to discuss electronic intermittency as a potential factor in SA incidents. It then reports a simple practical experiment that shows how mechanically induced electrical contact intermittencies can generate false speed signals that an automobile speed control system may accept as true and that do not trigger any diagnostic fault codes. Since the generation of accurate speed signals is essential for the proper functioning of a number of other automobile safety-critical control systems, the apparent ease with which false speed signals can be generated by vibration of a poor electrical contact is obviously a matter of general concern. Various ways of reducing the likelihood of SAs are discussed, including electrical contact improvements to reduce the likelihood of generating false speed signals, improved battery maintenance, and the incorporation of an independent fail-safe that reduces engine power in an emergency, such as a kill switch.",

        "abstract": "Low Earth orbit (LEO) mega-constellation satellite networks (LMCSNs) have shown great potential to extend the coverage capability of conventional terrestrial networks. The exploitation of the prevalent New Radio (NR) standard for LMCSNs can unleash the full potential toward a highly integrated satellite-terrestrial network. Despite this premise, how to systematically define, quantify, and assess the technical performance of NR enabled LMCSNs remains an open issue. In this paper, we address the challenging issue by proposing a holistic performance evaluation framework. Firstly, a key performance indicator (KPI) system including constellation-specific KPIs (i.e.,N-asset coverage, area traffic capacity, and service availability) and radio interface technology KPIs is devised. An efficient LEO constellation oriented performance assessment methodology is then carefully designed based on realistic beam layout and accurate interference modeling. We have carried out rigorous system-level simulations and provided extensive numerical results to assess the KPI system. It can be observed that the achieved area traffic capacity of the reference LEO constellation with 1800 satellites is less than 4 Kbps/km2. Besides, theN-asset coverage and service availability range from 5.95 to 11.45, and from 24.9% to 32.7%, respectively.",

        "abstract": "Node positioning or localization is a critical requisite for numerous position-based applications of wireless sensor network (WSN). Localization using the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is preferred over localization using fixed terrestrial anchor node (FTAN) because of low implementation complexity and high accuracy. The conventional multilateration technique estimates the position of the unknown node (UN) based on the distance from the anchor node (AN) to UN that is obtained from the received signal strength (RSS) measurement. However, distortions in the propagation medium may yield incorrect distance measurement and as a result, the accuracy of RSS-multilateration is limited. Though the optimization based localization schemes are considered to be a better alternative, the performance of these schemes is not satisfactory if the distortions are non-linear. In such situations, the neural network (NN) architecture such as extreme learning machine (ELM) can be a better choice as it is a highly non-linear classifier. The ELM is even superior over its counterpart NN classifiers like multilayer perceptron (MLP) and radial basis function (RBF) due to its fast and strong learning ability. Thus, this paper provides a comparative review of various soft computing based localization techniques using both FTAN and aerial ANs for better acceptability.",

Second, the gray levels of wave troughs are set to be a minimal constant, and the other gray levels are linearly interpolated for each radial. The method is validated by comparing the significant wave heights measured by buoy with those retrieved from X-band marine radar image sequences, the correlation coefficient and the root-mean-square error between them are 0.85 and 0.42 m with the correction of rain, which increases 0.34 and reduces 0.34 m compared with those estimated without the correction, respectively.

When these products include sophisticated electronics encased in 3D packaging with complex geometries and intricate detail, TTM can be compromised—resulting in lost opportunity. The use of advanced 3D printing technology enhanced with component placement and electrical interconnect deposition can provide electronic prototypes that now can be rapidly fabricated in comparable time frames as traditional 2D bread-boarded prototypes; however, these 3D prototypes include the advantage of being embedded within more appropriate shapes in order to authentically prototype products earlier in the development cycle. The fabrication freedom offered by 3D printing techniques, such as stereolithography and fused deposition modeling have recently been explored in the context of 3D electronics integration—referred to as 3D structural electronics or 3D printed electronics. Enhanced 3D printing may eventually be employed to manufacture end-use parts and thus offer unit-level customization with local manufacturing; however, until the materials and dimensional accuracies improve (an eventuality), 3D printing technologies can be employed to reduce development times by providing advanced geometrically appropriate electronic prototypes. This paper describes the development process used to design a novelty six-sided gaming die. The die includes a microprocessor and accelerometer, which together detect motion and upon halting, identify the top surface through gravity and illuminate light-emitting diodes for a striking effect. By applying 3D printing of structural electronics to expedite prototyping, the development cycle was reduced from weeks to hours.",

Moreover, free riding behavior is always inevitable in supply chain system. When a supply chain system includes free riding behavior and cross channel return strategy, the system is complex so that its stability can’t be ensured easily. Hence, the management of the complex supply chain system mentioned above is a major challenge. In this article, the inventory and profit control strategy for a dual channel supply chain (DCSC) with cross channel return and free riding behavior is developed. Firstly, the mathematical model of the supply chain is set up based on the discrete state space equation. Secondly, utilizing the Lyapunov stability theory and the linear matrix inequality (LMI) method, a robustH∞control strategy is designed to suppress the bullwhip effect caused by customer random demand. Thirdly, the impact of consumer channel preference, cross channel return and free riding behavior on inventory, production/ordering and profit in the supply chain system is studied by analyzing four different models, such as N-FC(without free riding behavior or cross channel return), Y-C(with cross channel return only), Y-F(with free riding behavior only), Y-FC(with both free riding behavior and cross channel return). Finally, the simulation tests are carried out to verify the performance of the robust control strategy, and some management insights and conclusions are summarized.",

Today’s mathematical modeling languages, such as Petri nets, are useful for describing distributed systems and complex networks. However, the flat model architecture of Petri nets makes it difficult for them to depict the compositional structures of a large-scale model. Therefore, an enhanced compositionality feature has become a significant demand in large-scale modeling with Petri nets. This paper explores the underlying compositional structures of a given Petri net model by using a proposed sorting algorithm. The algorithm analyses compositional structures by sorting an incidence matrix that is generated from the Petri net model. Finally, the proposed sorting algorithm is applied to a traffic network model that was built with Petri nets to analyze its compositional structures, which represent different traffic lines, with the aim of optimizing the traffic network.",

        "abstract": "As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly integrated into financial decision-making, its impact on corporate risk resilience remains an open question. Addressing this gap, our study empirically investigates how AI adoption influences firms’ financial stability by examining a large-scale dataset of 23,700 firm-year observations from Chinese A-share listed companies (2013–2022). Using text mining techniques, we construct an AI-related lexicon from annual reports to quantify AI adoption and employ fixed-effects regression models alongside instrumental variable estimation to assess AI’s impact on corporate financial leverage as a proxy for risk resilience. Our empirical results indicate that a one-standard-deviation increase in AI adoption is associated with a 10.6% reduction in financial leverage (β=−0.106, p <0.01), reinforcing AI’s role in enhancing financial resilience. Furthermore, executives’ technical expertise significantly strengthens this effect (β=−0.083, p <0.05), while international background shows a relatively modest influence. These findings provide new insights into the interplay between AI adoption, financial risk management, and executive characteristics, offering practical implications for firms leveraging AI to enhance financial stability. Furthermore, this study introduces senior executives’ international backgrounds, technical expertise, and innovation orientation as moderating variables. Empirical analysis reveals differences in their moderating effects: executives’ technical proficiency demonstrates the strongest positive impact on the AI-risk resilience relationship, followed by innovation orientation, with overseas experience showing a relatively modest influence. This study enhances the theoretical understanding of AI applications in financial management, offering practical insights for companies to improve risk resilience and financial decision-making. Given the ongoing advancements and deeper integration of AI, its influence on corporate financial decision-making and risk management is expected to grow, warranting further exploration.",

        "abstract": "The dynamic nature of vehicular networks with their fast changing topology poses several challenges to setup communication between vehicles. Packet collisions are considered to be the main source of data loss in contention-based vehicular networks. Retransmission of collided packets is done several times until an acknowledgment of successful reception is received or the maximum number of retries is reached. The retransmission delay is drawn randomly from an interval, called the backoff interval. A good choice of the backoff interval reduces the number of collisions and the waiting periods of data packets, which increases the throughput and decreases the energy consumption. An optimal backoff interval could be obtained if global network information spread in the network in a short time. However, this is practically not achievable which motivates the efficient utilization of local information to approach the optimal performance. In this paper, we propose a localized adaptive strategy that calculates the backoff interval for unicast applications in vehicular networks. The new strategy uses fuzzy logic to adapt the backoff interval to the fast changing vehicular environment using only local information. We present four schemes of that strategy that differ in their behavior and the number of inputs. We compare the proposed schemes with other known schemes, binary exponential backoff, backoff algorithm, and an optimal scheme, in terms of throughput, fairness, and energy consumption. Results show that by proper tuning of the fuzzy parameters and rules, one of the proposed schemes outperform the other schemes, and approach the optimal results.",

        "abstract": "Online social networks now play a prominent role in our daily lives and our decisions and behaviors in many areas. Of particular interest here is the application of social network data to give users access to tourist information. There is a growing need for information on tourism and tourist activities to satisfy user queries in this domain. Social networks, such as Facebook, Twitter, and Foursquare, among others, store substantial volumes of check-in data, which are a valuable resource for recommending tourism attractions. However, using Facebook check-in data has rarely been considered in conventional recommendation systems (RSs). This presents not only a new research challenge for the computer science and information technology fields but also an interesting opportunity for the tourism industry: knowing what kind of attractions tourists are interested in and how to acquire their user preferences without adding tasks to users of an RS. We propose a tourism RS that is based on its recommendations on data dynamically aggregated and extrapolated from the Facebook check-in data. In addition, the so-called “cold-start”problem has been resolved by using users' Friends' check-in data to analyze ongoing Facebook activity and update user profiles in the system. Most Facebook users have a well-extended list of Friends. Consequently, the proposed system can dynamically learn user behavior and appropriately adapt recommendations. This paper demonstrate the usefulness of the data available on Facebook through the example studies involving attraction recommendations, resolving the cold-start problem, and adapting the user model to improve recommendation quality in the tourism domain.",

        "abstract": "A novel pattern-reconfigurable cylindrical dielectric resonator antenna is presented. By the incorporation of four p-i-n diode switches and four parasitic elements, the mode of dielectric resonator excited by the probe changed. The antenna's radiation patterns can be shaped to concentrate energy in four specific directions, while minimizing the gain in other unwanted directions without affecting the impedance bandwidth of the antenna for its complete symmetry in structure. The antenna switches its radiation patterns among four reconfigurable modes with orthogonal directions at azimuth plane covering a bandwidth of several 870 MHz and exhibiting a high maximum gain of 9.74 dBi. A fully functional prototype has been designed, fabricated, and tested. The measured results of the reflection coefficient, radiation patterns, and realized gain verify the effectiveness of the proposed pattern switching concept for cylindrical dielectric resonator antenna. These capabilities make the antenna suitable for smart wireless devices in next generation communication systems as it can enhance the radio frequency front-end flexibility and performance by adding pattern diversity, especially for muti-input-muti-output systems in multipath environments.",

        "abstract": "Silane crosslinked polyethylene cable insulation occasionally fails to meet the aging requirements given in technical standards. The purpose of this paper is to investigate this phenomena and establish whether the safety margin of aging tests can be increased by changes in manufacture or test procedures. Using a number of cable types with different compositions and dimensions, the evolution of the absolute values of tensile strength and elongation at break upon aging was obtained. The results show that the major changes in mechanical properties happen within the first 24-48 h. This finding is valid both for ethylene vinylsilane copolymers and for grafted silane systems. In general, the effect is more pronounced for the 100°C compatibility test. Statistical analysis shows that insulation crosslinked in a hot waterbath will exhibit this behavior to a lesser extent, thus increasing the safety margin in aging tests, compared with ambient curing. This paper demonstrates that preconditioning at 70°C has no significant impact on aging properties. In addition, only small variations in mechanical properties were seen when changing the process parameters. It is concluded that further crosslinking is the principal cause of the phenomena under investigation.",

This paper proposes the utilization and control of repurposed EVBs in Community Energy Storage Systems (CESSs) in Low-Voltage (LV) distribution networks. A real-time Community Energy Management System (CEMS) is proposed for the control of the CESS, which uses repurposed EVBs and a power electronic interface comprised of a four-quadrant ac/dc converter and a bidirectional dc/dc converter together with the corresponding controllers. To assess the capability of the controller in providing CESS services in the form of active and reactive power control in an LV residential distribution network, four case studies are carried out using Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) simulations. The HIL simulations use an actual battery pack and a four-quadrants converter system. The impact of the proposed controller on the repurposed EVBs’ cycling performance is evaluated using a Rainflow Counting Algorithm (RCA). The distribution transformer Loss of Life (LoL) is also estimated. The HIL simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed real-time CEMS in slowing down the degradation of the battery and LoL of the distribution transformer, while improving the LV distribution system’s voltage profile.",

To reduce production costs and effectively use production capacity to improve competitiveness, a hybrid production system is necessary. The flexible job shop (FJS) is a hybrid production system, and the FJS problem (FJSP) has drawn considerable attention in the past few decades. This paper examined the FJSP and, like previous studies, aimed to minimize the total order completion time (makespan). We developed a novel method that involves encoding feasible solutions in the genes of the initial chromosomes of a genetic algorithm (GA) and embedding the Taguchi method behind mating to increase the effectiveness of the GA. Two numerical experiments were conducted for evaluating the performance of the proposed algorithm relative to that of the Brandimarte MK1–MK10 benchmarks. The first experiment involved comparing the proposed algorithm and the traditional GA. The second experiment entailed comparing the proposed algorithm with those presented in previous studies. The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is superior to those reported in previous studies (except for that of Zhang et al.: the results in experiment MK7 were superior to those of Zhang, the results in experiments MK6 and MK10 were slightly inferior to those of Zhang, and the results were equivalent in other experiments) and effectively overcomes the encoding problem that occurs when a GA is used to solve the FJSP.",

Furthermore, a spectrum allocation algorithm based on stable matching is proposed for cognitive satellite network. According to the transmission characteristics of satellite communication, utility functions of cognitive satellite are given. Users can form stable matching between PUs and SUs through independent negotiation. The spectrum allocation algorithm proposed in this paper has low complexity and can adapt to dynamic networks.

        "abstract": "Pose Guided Person Image Generation (PGPIG) is a task that involves generating an image of a person in a target pose, given an image in a source pose, source pose information and target pose information. Many of the existing PGPIG techniques need extra pose-related data or tasks, which cause the limitations on their applicability. In addition CNNs are used as the feature extractor which do not have long-range dependency. However, CNNs can only extract features from neighboring pixels and cannot consider image consistency. This paper introduces a PGPIG network that solves these challenges by incorporating modules that use Axial Transformers with wide receptive fields. The proposed approach disentangles the PGPIG task into two subtasks: “rough pose transformation” and “detailed texture generation.” In “rough pose transformation,” lower-resolution feature maps is processed by Axial Transformer-based blocks. These blocks employ an Encoder-Decoder structure, which allows the network to use the pose information well and improves the stability and performance of the training. The latter subtask employs a CNN network with Adaptive Instance Normalization. Experimental results show the competitive performance of the proposed method compared to existing methods. The proposed method achieves lowest LPIPS in Deep Fashion dataset and FID in Market-1501 dataset. Remarkably, despite the great results obtained, the number of parameters of the proposed network is significantly less in contrast to existing methods.",

The intent of PSE is to maximize the reuse of existing knowledge of business and design practices and existing technical assets in the development of new smart-space applications. Business knowledge is mostly informal and domain-dependent, but architectural knowledge is generic, at least semiformal, and represented in principles, ontologies, patterns, and rules that together form a reusable architectural knowledge base for fast smart-space application development.

In this paper, we aim to understand the traffic nature of MIM in cellular networks. Specifically, in order to reach credible conclusions, our research takes account of practical measurement records of MIM services from China Mobile at two different levels. First, a data set of individual message level (IML) traffic is exploited and reveals power-law distributed message length and lognormal distributed interarrival time, the heavy-tailness of which completely diverts from the geometric model and the exponential model recommended by the 3rd generation partnership project (3GPP). Second, another data set considers the statistical pattern of aggregated traffic within one whole base station, and demonstrates the accuracy ofα-stable models for the aggregated traffic. Furthermore, it verifies that theα-stable models are suitable for characterizing the traffic in both the conventional fixed core networks and the cellular access networks. At last, with the aid of the generalized central limit theorem, we build up a theoretical relation between the distributions of IML traffic and aggregated traffic.",

        "abstract": "Cervical cancer is a severe and pervasive disease that poses a significant health threat to women globally. The Pap smear test is an efficient and effective method for detecting cervical cancer in its early stages. However, manual screening is labor-intensive and requires expert cytologists, leading to potential delays and inconsistencies in diagnosis. Deep Learning-based Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) has shown significant results and can ease the problem of manual screening. However, one single model is sometimes insufficient to capture the complex data pattern for accurate disease prediction. In this work, we develop an end-to-end architecture utilizing three pre-trained models for the initial cervical cancer prediction. To aggregate the outcomes of these models, we propose a novel fuzzy rank-based ensemble considering two non-linear functions for the final level prediction. Unlike simple fusion techniques, the proposed architecture provides the final predictions on the test samples by considering the base classifier’s confidence in the predictions. To further enhance the classification capabilities of these models, we integrate advanced augmentation techniques such as CutOut, MixUp, and CutMix. The proposed model is evaluated on two benchmark datasets, SIPaKMeD and Mendeley LBC, using a 5-fold cross-validation approach. On the SIPaKMeD dataset, the proposed ensemble architecture achieves a classification accuracy of 97.18% and an F1 score of 97.16%. On the Mendeley LBC dataset, the accuracy reaches 99.22% with an F1 score of 99.19%. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed architecture’s effectiveness and potential in cervical Pap smear image classification. This could aid medical professionals in making more informed treatment decisions, improving overall effectiveness in the testing process.",

They are a new class of spheromaks because they are observed to be stable in partial atmosphere with no confining external toroidal magnetic fields, and are observed to endure for more than 600 ms. Included in this paper is a model that explains these stable plasma toroids (spheromaks); they are hollow plasma toroids with a thin outer shell of electrons and ions that all travel in parallel paths orthogonal to the toroid circumference—in effect, spiraling around the toroid. These toroids include sufficient ions to neutralize the space charge of the electrons. This model leads to the name Electron Spiral Toroid Spheromak (ESTS). The discovery of this new class of spheromaks resulted from work to explain ball lightning. A comparison is made between the experimental observations of spheromaks in partial atmosphere and reported ball lightning observations; strong similarities are reported. The ESTS is also found to have a high ion density of>1019ions/cm3without needing any external toroidal magnetic field for containment, compared, for example, to tokamaks, with ion density limits of∼1015ions/cm3. This high ion density is a defining characteristic and opens the potential to be useful in applications. The ESTS is a field reversed configuration plasma toroid.",

This paper considers a point-to-point channel with the transmitter powered by random energy harvester, for which the energy arrival process is stochastic, and the save-then-transmit scheme is adopted due to the battery half-duplex constraint: The transmitter first harvests energy for a certain time, and then stops EH to transmit information with all the accumulated energy at the battery. Obviously, it is crucial to determine a proper stopping time for EH, since larger EH duration provides more accumulated energy, while it may decrease the average throughput. In this paper, our goal is to compute the optimal stopping time to maximize the average throughput of the considered EH systems. First, considering the Gaussian channel scenario, this paper proves the existence of the optimal stopping rule and shows that this rule has a state-dependent\"threshold-based\" structure under the Markov energy arrival case. Then, for a special independent and identically distributed energy arrival case, this paper further proves that the corresponding stopping threshold is a constant, and can be efficiently computed by a proposed algorithm. Finally, this paper generalizes the above results to the fading channel scenario and obtains the corresponding optimal stopping rule, which can be computed by a recursive algorithm.",

For periodic messages, minimizing the delay jitter means messages should be transmitted at the expected time in every period. In this paper, we investigate the scheduling problem to reduce the delay jitter for periodic messages in networked safety critical embedded systems. Our approach is empirically assigning an expected completion time as a baseline for the periodic messages and minimizing the total deviation to them. It can be applied either in centralized control buses or in synchronized ones. This paper selects a novel bus protocol and UM-BUS, to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. UM-BUS is a multi-master bus with the capability of multi-lane concurrent transmission. Aiming at different operation mode of UM-BUS, we implemented two sets of experiments by configuring different parameters to change the bus utilization. The results show that the heuristic algorithm works effectively and can achieve a deviation within 0.35%, which is significantly smaller comparing with the existing scheduling algorithms.",

This article presents a mathematical framework and approach for addressing the challenge of nonlinear systems like quad-copter. A novel control system for the quad-copter’s positions(z,y,x)and attitudes (roll (ϕ), yaw (ψ), pitch (θ)) has been proposed based on optimisation techniques that are integrated with proportional-integral (PI) controllers. Astute position update methods such as helical, circular, etc. have been introduced using different algorithms like particle swarm optimization (PSO), grey Wolf optimization (GWO), and the diversified grey wolf optimizer (DGWOA) algorithm. Following that, in an iterative procedure, a variety of leadership levels are used to update the individual’s position, and the leadership is modified through the use of an adaptive mechanism. For validation, the proposed algorithm’s effectiveness is evaluated based on the convergence rate compared to that of other meta-heuristic algorithms. Owing to its inadequate exploration, PSO leads to challenges with parameter selection, whereas GWO is easy to get to the local optimum. The concept and execution of DGWOA have been implemented to update the Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) controlled parameters in order to overcome these limitations. The proposed algorithm’s performance for path planning in a complex and cluttered environment is investigated. The simulation shows that the DGWOA algorithm has a faster response as compared to the reference and(z,y,x)has been improved with (92.87, 96.95, and 99.69) percentage along with eliminating the shortcomings of PSO & GWO.",

        "abstract": "Our world is rapidly changing, and swiftly evolving towards so-called “smart worlds”. The smart worlds starting with smart things such as the smart objects, smart city, smart manufacturing, and smart systems, will eventually encompass all aspects of the cyber, physical, social and mental world. A cyber-enabled completely new digital space featured with ubiquitous interconnections, integrations and interactions of physical, social, mental and other spaces will continuously bring out more and more changes. Cyberspace is actually the combinational outcome of various technologies including computers, communications, materials, intelligence and studies in perception, cognition, biology, sociology, etc., as well as advanced computing like the Internet/Web, pervasive networks, ubiquitous sensing and computing, the internet of things, the cloud, big data and so forth. These smart worlds are set to be the next important stage in human history. We have to be aware of the essential problems and crucial issues affecting in building truly smart worlds that benefit humanity, and simultaneously safeguard the natural environment for sustainable development and evolution. Therefore, this is the time to foresee future trends and identify what the grand challenges for smart worlds are.

        "abstract": "This paper discusses object proposal generation, which is a crucial step of instance-level semantic segmentation (instance segmentation). Known as a challenging computer vision task, the instance segmentation requires jointly detecting and segmenting individual instances of objects in an image. A common approach to this task is first to propose a set of class-agnostic object candidates in the forms of segmentation masks, which represent both object locations and boundaries, and then to perform classification on each object candidate. In this paper, we propose an effective refinement process that employs image transformations and mask matching to increase the accuracy of object segmentation masks. The proposed refinement process is applied to three state-of-the-art object proposal methods (DeepMask, SharpMask, and FastMask), and is evaluated on two standard benchmarks (Microsoft COCO and PASCAL VOC). Both the quantitative and qualitative results show the effectiveness of the process across various experimental settings.",

Analyzing and collecting features for the model creation process from the network traffic traces is a time-consuming and error-prone task. Automating these procedures are a challenge. The research problem discussed in this paper concentrates on the analysis and collection of features from the network traffic traces for the model development process, by automating the analysis and collection. The proposed system of this paper, called MGtoolV2, supports the model development process through the automation of collection and analysis in the actual model creation procedures. The model development process aims to enhance the development of a model by reducing the development cost and time. The proposed tool automatically creates large sets of models according to the network traffic traces and minimizes the errors of manual modeling. The experiments conducted with MGtoolV2 indicate that the tool is able to create the models from the traffic traces cost effectively. MGtoolV2 is able to unify similarities between packets, to create very detailed models describing specific information, and to raise the abstraction level of the created models. The research is based on the constructive method of the related publications and technologies, and the results are established from the testing, validation, and analysis of the implemented MGtoolV2.",

        "abstract": "With the maturity of technologies, such as HTML5 and JavaScript, and with the increasing popularity of cross-platform frameworks, such as Apache Cordova, mobile cloud computing as a new design paradigm of mobile application developments is becoming increasingly more accessible to developers. Following this trend, future on-device mobile application ecosystems will not only comprise a mixture of native and remote applications, but also include multiple hybrid mobile cloud applications. The resource competition in such ecosystems and its impact over the performance of mobile cloud applications has not yet been studied. In this paper, we study this competition from a game theoretical perspective and examine how it affects the behavior of mobile cloud applications. Three offload decision models of cooperative and non-cooperative nature are constructed and their efficiency compared. We present an extension to the classic load balancing game to model the offload behaviors within a non-cooperative environment. Mixed-strategy Nash equilibria are derived for the non-cooperative offload game with complete information, which further quantifies the price of anarchy in such ecosystems. We present simulation results that demonstrate the differences between each decision model's efficiency. Our modeling approach facilitates further research in the design of the offload decision engines of mobile cloud applications. Our extension to the classic load balancing game broadens its applicability to real-life applications.",

This paper presents a novel discriminative model named context-based max-margin to perform the task of classification for polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) images. Based on the max-margin frame, support vector machine (SVM), and conditional random fields (CRF) are used to describe the spectral and spatial information of polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) image, respectively. First, the probabilistic result which is obtained from SVM can be applied as the spectral term of the discriminative classifier. Second, CRF is used to describe the spatial information of PolSAR image. The contextual information of both label and observation field are built as the spatial term, by which the smoother region is obtained and the spatial information is preserved. Finally, a discriminative classifier can be learned by means of integrating the spectral and spatial terms. Compared with other state-of-the-art classification methods, our method exhibits higher accuracy, which indicating the effectiveness of our scheme. Here, the total classification accuracy of the proposed model increases by about 10% and 3% compared with the other methods for two data sets.",

        "abstract": "The massive deployment of the Internet of Things (IoT) combined with the need to reduce its impact on global energy consumption calls for the design of intelligent sensors. These sensors must be able to process information in situ to reduce the amount of data to be transferred, and to perform computing at low energy cost. Therefore, the design of intelligent sensors requires a compromise between performance and energy consumption. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are good candidates for achieving the goal of an efficient intelligent sensor, as they use event-based computation. Interest for hardware implementation of SNNs has bloomed since the first experimental observation of memristors in 2008. In this paper, we study, by simulation means, the impact of the main technological parameters of Ferroelectric Tunnel Junctions (FTJs) synapses and of analog Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neurons on the system learning capabilities. This allows us to determine which parameters are critical for the design of such systems and to suggest mitigation solutions as well as guidelines on how to build a SNN-based smart vision sensor in the context of unsupervised or reward-modulated learning. In particular, we show that splitting up the passive crossbar array of memristors could help dealing with the detrimental effect of the input voltage offset of the postsynaptic neurons.",

        "abstract": "Recent years have seen increasing popularity of storing and managing personal multimedia data using online services. Preserving confidentiality of online personal data while offering efficient functionalities thus becomes an important and pressing research issue. In this paper, we study the problem of content-based search of image data archived online while preserving content confidentiality. The problem has different settings from those typically considered in the secure computation literature, as it deals with data in rank-ordered search, and has a different security-efficiency requirement. Secure computation techniques, such as homomorphic encryption, can potentially be used in this application, at a cost of high computational and communication complexity. Alternatively, efficient techniques based on randomizing visual feature and search indexes have been proposed recently to enable similarity comparison between encrypted images. This paper focuses on comparing these two major paradigms of techniques, namely, homomorphic encryption-based techniques and feature/index randomization-based techniques, for confidentiality-preserving image search. We develop novel and systematic metrics to quantitatively evaluate security strength in this unique type of data and applications. We compare these two paradigms of techniques in terms of their search performance, security strength, and computational efficiency. The insights obtained through this paper and comparison will help design practical algorithms appropriate for privacy-aware cloud multimedia systems.",

Similar as general multicarrier signals, the high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) is also one of the main drawbacks of MFTN signals. Unfortunately, the PAPR problem in MFTN signaling system has rarely been considered in the literatures. In this paper, we investigate the PAPR reduction for MFTN signals. First, we derive an inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT)-based implementation of the MFTN transmitter. Based on which, a novel partial transmit sequence (PTS) scheme is proposed for the PAPR reduction of MFTN signals. The proposed PTS scheme relies on a two-stage optimization of the phase weighting factors for the parallel IFFT blocks as well as the phase weighting factors for the information symbols before the summation operation. It is shown that the proposed scheme substantially outperforms the direct employment of conventional Nyquist multicarrier transmission systems-based PTS scheme and also robust to the overlap-add operation introduced by pulse shaping.",

Therefore, the YOLOv5m-D model and its static and dynamic characteristics are proposed to detect and identify smoke and flame throughout the entire process of grassland fires, and its effectiveness is verified. The experimental results showed that in smoke recognition and detection, YOLOv5m-D model showed slow local convergence under the condition of low Learning rate, and the mAP value of YOLOv5m-D was 86.4% when the batch size was 16. In the comparison of mAP values under the optimal hyperparameters, the Faster RCNN value was 72.34%, SSD value was 75.90%, YOLOv5m value was 86.75%, and YOLOv5m-D value was 89.28%, which was higher than the comparison model. In flame recognition detection, in the Hu1 moment, the ordinary image sequence and infrared thermal imaging sequence, except for a few that were around 0.8, were mostly maintained at around 0.3-0.7, while the color tent was both below 0.1. After combining infrared images with flame static and dynamic feature recognition, the flames are basically recognized. In the comparison of single feature recognition time, the current frame recognition time of different images under the vast majority of features is lower than the reference frame. Overall, the YOLOv5m-D model proposed in the study and its static and dynamic characteristics are effective in detecting and identifying smoke and flame throughout the entire process of grassland fires, and have high practical effects for practical grassland fire detection.",

In this paper, we propose a backward-compatible ICN architecture to address the caching issue in particular. The key idea is implementing edge caching in ICN, using a coalition of end clients and edge servers. Our solution can be deployed in IP networks with HTTP requests. We performed a trace-driven simulation for analyzing peer-assisted information-centric networking (PICN) benefits using IRCache and Berkeley trace files. The results show that on average, PICN decreases the latency for 78% and increases the content retrieval speed for 69% compared with a direct download from the original Web servers. When comparing PICN with a solution based on central proxy servers, we show that the hit ratio obtained using a small cache size in each PICN client is almost 14% higher than the hit ratio obtained with a central proxy server using an unlimited cache storage.",

Wide-band reflectometry using adequate antennas system represents a possible way, but sometimes more accuracy is required which can be achieved by the use of implantable sensors that can closely investigate the interested tissues and are able to communicate with the external systems. For some applications, this communication can be unidirectional for monitoring purposes, but even in these cases, the transceiver should be carefully designed to obtain the necessary data while generating as low as possible radiofrequency power within the tissues. Blood and/or soft/hard tissue analysis can be based on this technique. The received signal is processed locally or sent to a remote medical center for further processing. The algorithms to extract the information are quite complex, and the low signal to noise ratio makes the analysis even more challenging. A bi-directional communication on the other hand represents a considerable advancement, when the sensor nodes are remotely controlled based on the feedback of the received data, for controlled drug release applications, as an example. Nevertheless, the reduced transmitter-receiver distance and presence of different high-loss tissues introduce strong reflections.",

        "abstract": "Generalized spatial modulation (GSM) as a novel multiple-antenna transmission technique is an extension of spatial modulation (SM). The GSM system provides flexibility in terms of spectral efficiency, energy efficiency, and the cost of radio-frequency (RF) chains. In the literature, cross Z-complementary pair (CZCP) has been proposed for optimal training sequence design in SM, but not for GSM. Due to its specific zero correlation zone (ZCZ) properties for autocorrelation sums and cross-correlation sums, optimal channel estimation performance in SM over frequency-selective channels can be achieved. In this paper, we propose an efficient construction for mutually orthogonal mate of a CZCP and provide a new construction of CZCPs. Based on the proposed CZCP and its mate, a novel training framework of GSM system is presented to achieve the minimum mean square error (MSE) channel estimation performance in frequency-selective channels. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed CZCP-mate-based training for the GSM system can eliminate inter-symbol interference (ISI) and inter-antenna interference (IAI).",

AI techniques—that subsume multidisciplinary techniques from machine learning, optimization theory, game theory, control theory, and meta-heuristics—have long been applied to optimize computer networks in many diverse settings. Such an approach is gaining increased traction with the emergence of novel networking paradigms that promise to simplify network management (e.g., cloud computing, network functions virtualization, and software-defined networking) and provide intelligent services (e.g., future 5G mobile networks). Looking ahead, greater integration of AI into networking architectures can help develop a future vision of cognitive networks that will show network-wide intelligent behavior to solve problems of network heterogeneity, performance, and quality of service (QoS).",

In this protocol, a secret key is distributed to a sender and a receiver who share entangled states with a third trusted party but not with each other. This secret key is distributed by the means of special pure quantum states using remote state preparation and controlled gates. In addition, we employ the parity bits of the entangled pairs and the ancillary states to assist in preparing and measuring the secret states. Distributing a state to two users requires two maximally entangled pairs as the quantum channel and a two-particle von Neumann projective measurement. The proposed protocol is exact and deterministic. It distributes a secret key of d qubits by the means of 2d entangled pairs and, on average, d bits of classical communication. We demonstrate the security of this protocol against entanglement attacks and present a method of privacy amplification.",

Nowadays, the philosophy of drug discovery has been transformed from one-drug one-target to multiple-drug multiple-targets, called as Polypharmacology, in order to discover new drugs or novel targets for existing drugs, known as Drug repurposing. In particular, the improvements in drug discovery for complex diseases such as cancer, could be achieved by studying drug action through network biology. These networks has contributed to the genesis of Network pharmacology. Integrating and analyzing heterogeneous genome-scale data is a huge algorithmic challenge for modern systems biology. In this paper Power Graph Analysis (PGA) has been applied to explore the tripartite Drug-Target-Disease networks, which is a lossless transformation of biological networks into a compact, less redundant representation. Specifically, the effectiveness of Power Graph is analysed with state-of-the-art SNS (Shared Neighbourhood Scoring) algorithm, in two case studies. We analysed two separate integrated tripartite biomedical networks from: 1) PharmDB, a tripartite pharmacological network database; and 2) COVIDrugNet, the SARS-CoV-2 Virus-Host-Drug Interactome. Despite very high edge reduction, PGA helps to easily explore much more enriched information without any loss and discover novel potential drugs currently in clinical trial to treat lung cancer - Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC) and SARS-CoV-2 diseases. Also it outperformed SNS algorithm in terms of accuracy and efficiency, as the SNS algorithm requires computationally expensive calculations for large networks.

Both line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight scenarios were considered. Measurements were performed by fixing a transmit pyramidal horn antenna, and rotating another one in the receiver site at 10° steps in azimuth. The antenna outputs are viewed as array signals, and a space-alternating generalized expectation-maximization (SAGE) algorithm is applied to estimate delay and angular parameters of multipath components. Benefiting from high resolution achieved by using the SAGE and deembedding of antenna radiation pattern and system responses, more multipath clusters with less spreads in delay and azimuth are found per channel compared with existing works on 28-GHz propagation. The statistics of channel parameters extracted here constitute a preliminary stochastic multipath-cluster spatial channel model.",

One reason is that aesthetic preference is highly subjective and may vary significantly among people for certain images. Thus, it is important to properly model and quantify such subjectivity, but there has not been much effort to resolve this issue. In this paper, we propose a novel probabilistic framework that can model and quantify subjective aesthetic preference based on the subjective logic. In this framework, the rating distribution is modeled as a beta distribution, from which the probabilities of being definitely pleasing, being definitely unpleasing, and being uncertain can be obtained. We use the probability of being uncertain to define an intuitive metric of subjectivity. Furthermore, we present a method to learn deep neural networks for prediction of image aesthetics, which is shown to be effective in improving the performance of subjectivity prediction via experiments.",

In this approach, the map features are converted into map agent, object agent, group agent, and conflicting agent, and the spatial relationships between these features are managed by an auxiliary relationship agent. Each agent is assigned with tasks accordingly, and all agents collaborate with each other to complete the generalization. The snake-based algorithm is applied in the conflicting agent when it identifies a certain configuration.

In the article by Dao et al., \"Adaptive resource balancing for serviceability maximization in fog radio access networks,\" the authors propose an adaptive resource balancing (ARB) scheme for serviceability maximization in fog radio access networks wherein the resource block (RB) utilization among remote radio heads (RRHs) is balanced using the backpressure algorithm with respect to a time-varying network topology issued by potential RRH motilities. The optimal UE selection for service migration from a high-RB-utilization RRH to its neighboring low RB-utilization RRHs is determined by the Hungarian method to minimize RB occupation after moving the service.

Essentially, the DP algorithms strive to define a speed profile that reduces energy consumption while meeting specific journey distances and targeted travel times, thereby optimizing the operational speed of a train traversing between stations within permissible limits. However, there has been a relative paucity of research dedicated to ascertaining the ideal travel time for each station segment in an optimal manner. In this regard, this study devised a DP methodology with the goal of optimizing both the speed and the travel time for each station section, taking into account a predetermined total running time for a line composed of multiple stations under single train circumstances. To verify its effectiveness, the proposed optimization approach was compared with actual train operational data, encompassing recorded speeds and energy usage. Simulations were carried out mirroring real-world constraints, and the resultant solution adheres to the same speed limitations, distance, and travel time. Additionally, a methodology was introduced to account for any discrepancies between the actual train system and the simulation model. This was validated by comparing the actual energy consumption with the modeled energy consumption for each operational segment, demonstrating a modeling error of less than 1%.",

Nevertheless, researchers have attacked this challenge through different techniques, and much progress has been achieved in the past decade. Thus, it is useful to reflect on the current achievements and shortcomings and to identify potential areas of improvements. This paper presents the first comprehensive and systematic literature study to structure and categorize the research contributions for constrained interaction testing. Following the guidelines of conducting a literature study, the relevant data are extracted from a set of 103 research papers belonging to constrained interaction testing. The topics addressed in constrained interaction testing research are classified into four categories of constraint test generation, application, generation and application, and model validation studies. The papers within each of these categories are extensively reviewed. Apart from answering several other research questions, this paper also discusses the applications of constrained interaction testing in several domains, such as software product lines, fault detection and characterization, test selection, security, and graphical user interface testing.

However, implementing DML circuits using the standard design flow and Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools is very challenging, since DML gates operate in two different modes, each with its own characteristics and operating mechanisms. This paper shows, for the first time, that DML logic can be compatible with the standard design flow and optimized by various tools, such as synthesis and physical design. A DML cell library characterization methodology is also proposed to support the design flow. The methodology and flow were verified on a wide variety of benchmark designs with different gate counts and logic depths, and show that DML design is efficient under the standard design flow restrictions.",

        "abstract": "Visual surveillance requires robust detection of foreground objects under challenging environments of abrupt lighting variation, stationary foreground objects, dynamic background objects, and severe weather conditions. Most classical algorithms leverage background model images produced by statistical modeling of the change of brightness values over time. Since they have difficulties using global features, many false detections occur at the stationary foreground regions and dynamic background objects. Recent deep learning-based methods can easily reflect global characteristics compared to classical methods. However, deep learning-based methods still need to be improved in utilizing spatiotemporal information. We propose an algorithm for efficiently using spatiotemporal information by adopting a split and merge framework. First, we split spatiotemporal information on successive multiple images into spatial and temporal parts using two sub-networks of semantic and motion networks. Finally, separated information is fused in a spatiotemporal fusion network. The proposed network consists of three sub-networks, which we note as MSF-NET (Motion and Semantic features Fusion NETwork). Also, we propose a method to train the proposed MSF-NET stably.

Directional modulation, as a conventional type of secure modulations, transmits confidential information along the desired directions of legitimate receivers, and artificial noise in other directions, to deliberately confuse eavesdroppers in line-of-sight channels. Recently, artificial noise is also introduced into spatial modulation, leading to a secure spatial modulation strategy. In this Special Section in IEEE A CCESS, secure modulation is defined broadly as any secure modulation method, which includes, but is not limited to, secure directional modulation, secure spatial modulation, and secure index modulation.",

This approach jointly considers the principal resources (i.e., CPU, memory, storage, and bandwidth) with the goal of minimizing the total cost. Then, a cost-optimized resource provisioning policy (CORPP) based on game theory is applied to this mechanism that considers the Nash equilibrium between cloud users as well as the Stackelberg equilibrium between users and the cloud provider. The experimental results show that the proposed combinatorial pricing mechanism is more suitable in a heterogeneous cloud environment when running various types of cloudlets.

The inherent limitations of the YOLOv8 model in scenarios with a low signal-to-noise ratio and complex tasks are addressed, with a focus on improving the multi-scale feature representation within the YOLOv8 framework and effectively filtering out irrelevant regions. To achieve this, two crucial modules, D_C2f and D_SPPF, are integrated. Deformable convolutions (DCN) are utilized by these modules to dynamically adjust the visual receptive fields of the network. Furthermore, a Bi-level Routing Attention mechanism (BRA) and Dynamic Heads (DyHeads) are adapted within the feature fusion network, refining feature maps and enhancing semantic representation through attention mechanisms. Significant improvements are demonstrated by DBD-YOLOv8 when compared to the YOLOv8-n∖s∖m∖l∖xseries models. Notably, improved average mAP@0.5 values on benchmark datasets, including FLIR, OTCBVS (Dataset 01), OTCBVS (Dataset 03), and VEDAI, are achieved by DBD-YOLOv8.

        "abstract": "In evaluating the performance of software defect prediction models, accuracy measures such as precision and recall are commonly used. However, most of these measures are affected by neg/pos ratio of the data set being predicted, where neg is the number of negative cases (defect-free modules) and pos is the number of positive cases (defective modules). Thus, it is not fair to compare such values across different data sets with different neg/pos ratios and it may even lead to misleading or contradicting conclusions. The objective of this study is to address the class imbalance issue in assessing performance of defect prediction models. The proposed method relies on computation of expected values of accuracy measures based solely on the value of the neg and pos values of the data set. Based on the expected values, we derive the neg/pos-normalized accuracy measures, which are defined as their divergence from the expected value divided by the standard deviation of all possible prediction outcomes. The proposed measures enable us to provide a ranking of predictions across different data sets, which can distinguish between successful predictions and unsuccessful predictions. Our results derived from a case study of defect prediction based on 19 defect data sets indicate that ranking of predictions is significantly different than the ranking of conventional accuracy measures such as precision and recall as well as composite measures F1-value, AUC of ROC, MCC, G-mean and Balance. In addition, we conclude that MCC attains a better defect prediction accuracy than F1-value, AUC of ROC, G-mean and Balance.",

Since the maneuvering parameters are unknown, variable diameter arc helixes with different parameters can be used to match the maneuver track. Using the idea of Radon Transform(RT), the problem of maneuvering trajectory detection and tracking is transformed into the energy peak detection problem in VDAH-RT parameter domain.

        "abstract": "In recent years, Doppler-only sensors have demonstrated an excellent estimation performance for target tracking. Most of the existing tracking algorithms that utilize Doppler sensors rely on the assumption that sensors capture only measurement errors, disregarding measurement biases. However, in many practical situations, there can be significant measurement biases, which can severely compromise the performance of target state estimation. Recognizing this issue, the study proposes a new joint estimation algorithm that is exclusively reliant on Doppler-only sensors. The proposed algorithm not only provides the estimated results of the target state, but also the measurement bias of the Doppler sensor in use. The approach unfolds in two stages: the first stage is to estimate the target state without considering the measurement bias; the second is to perform bias compensation using the least squares method, and the target state and measurement bias are jointly estimated by linearization of the measurement equation. To validate the efficacy of this method, we analyzed the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for measurement bias estimation and designed simulations under both static and moving sensor scenarios to assess its performance. The results indicate that the proposed algorithm can effectively estimate the target state, outperforming Kalman filter (KF) in both the moving and static sensor scenario. The root mean square error (RMSE) of the bias estimation can approach the CRLB.",

The effective relative permittivities are calculated utilizing the time-domain finite integration technique. The effective permittivity of disordered mixtures deviates from established mixing theories especially in cases of high permittivity contrast between inclusions and matrix material, and is strongly correlated to the cross-sectional area of the inclusion crystals. Electric energy density localizes at the edges and corners of inclusions in a manner independent of inclusion shape and influenced by EM propagation direction and surrounding inclusions. For mixtures with both disordered irregular and more organized cube inclusions, energy localization increases as the EM signal travels through the mixture before decreasing due to attenuation of the propagating EM signal. With a large number of inclusion crystals (here in the hundreds), it is found that the impact on effective permittivity from differences in individual inclusion shapes is negligible.",

As a matter of fact, such an emerging adoption of FPGAs in the commodity systems is attributed to their versatility came from the programmable property. Accordingly many industrial and academic attempts have been performed to exploit FPGAs in a variety of applications. In this paper, we note that FPGAs also can be used to protect the host CPU from a nasty security threat, called code reuse attacks (CRAs). Code reuse attack (CRA) is a powerful technique that allows attackers to execute arbitrary code. Control-flow integrity (CFI) has been popularly employed to mitigate CRAs. CFI entails CRA monitoring that checks if a program runs as directed by its control-flow graph. However, as monitoring naturally incurs non-negligible runtime overhead to the host CPU, many studies proposed hardware techniques to lessen the monitoring overhead. To facilitate the immediate deployment of a hardware-based solution, we propose a CRA monitor, called ActiMon, that can be implemented on an SoC FPGA where the host CPU and FPGA are manufactured together in a single platform. However, implementing the CRA monitor operating on FPGA arouses a new challenge that has never been addressed in the previous solutions: the operating clock of FPGA is many times slower than the CPU. By overcoming this speed difference, we ultimately purpose to evince the feasibility of FPGA as a computing device in the field of CRA defense. For this purpose, we have developed a highly efficient algorithm designed to run on FPGA whose goal is to monitor the existence of CRAs on the host CPU residing in the same SoC FPGA platform. Empirical results show that ActiMon runs on our target SoC FPGA platform efficiently enough to catch up to the speed of host code execution and promptly detects two important types of CRAs, JOP (Jump-Oriented Programming) and ROP (Return-Oriented Programming), as soon as they occurred in the host syste...",

To carry out the computation of the trajectory of the system, a hierarchical structure of the ODEs is exploited, and an ARK solver is implemented in compute unified device architecture/C++ (CUDA/C++) on GPUs. The result is a 75-fold speedup for calculations of 2436 independent modules within the genetic network describing clock function relative to a comparable CPU architecture.

The existing methods regard this problem as a spatiotemporal sequence forecasting problem and try to resolve it in a one-shot fashion, which causes the prediction result being blurry or inaccurate. So, a more intuitional thought is to split this problem into two parts: model the dynamic pattern of the given video and learn the appearance representation of given video frames. In this paper, we develop a novel network structure named MixPred based on this idea to address this issue. We divide the prediction problem into two parts as mentioned above and build two subnets to solve these two parts separately. Instead of fusing the results of subnets at the final layer, we put forward a parallel interaction style through the whole process to merge the dynamic information and content information in a more natural way. Besides, we propose three different connection methods for exploring the most effective connection structure. We trained the model on UCF-101 and KITTI, and testing our model on UCF-101, KITTI, and Caltech.

        "abstract": "Distributed optical fiber sensors have gained an increasingly prominent role in structural-health monitoring. These are composed of an optical fiber cable in which a light impulse is launched by an opto-electronic device. The scattered light is of interest in the spectral domain: the spontaneous Brillouin spectrum is centered on the Brillouin frequency, which is related to the local strain and temperature changes in the optical fiber. When coupled with an industrial Brillouin optical time-domain analyzer (B-OTDA), an optical fiber cable can provide distributed measurements of strain and/or temperature, with a spatial resolution over kilometers of 40 cm. This paper focuses on the functioning of a B-OTDA device, where we address the problem of the improvement of spatial resolution. We model a Brillouin spectrum measured within an integration base of 1 m as the superposition of the elementary spectra contained in the base. Then, the spectral distortion phenomenon can be mathematically explained: if the strain is not constant within the integration base, the Brillouin spectrum is composed of several elementary spectra that are centered on different local Brillouin frequencies. We propose a source separation methodology approach to decompose a measured Brillouin spectrum into its spectral components. The local Brillouin frequencies and amplitudes are related to a portion of the integration base where the strain is constant. A layout algorithm allows the estimation of a strain profile with new spatial resolution chosen by the user. Numerical tests enable the finding of the optimal parameters, which provides a reduction to 1 cm of the 40-cm spatial resolution of the B-OTDA device. These parameters are highlighted during a comparison with a reference strain profile acquired by a 5-cm-resolution Rayleigh scatter analyzer under controlled conditions. In comparison with the B-OTDA strain profile, our estimated strain profile has better accuracy, with centimeter spatial resolut...",

However, data artifacts may be introduced in these measurements due to various factors such as loss of communication, loss of GPS signal, internal clock error, and vendor-specific implementation of phasor estimation algorithms. Tools designed to provide actionable insights from synchrophasor data, hence, must be designed to be robust to these data quality issues. To test the performance of algorithms in the presence of bad data encountered in field measurements, researchers need access to real-world examples of such data artifacts. To address this need, two years of synchrophasor data sourced from multiple electric utilities in the United States were analyzed to identify examples of data quality problems. These examples were then labeled and published in the Grid Event Signature Library, a publicly available repository of power system measurements hosted by the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. This paper describes the data curation process, and illustrates two application use cases where the dataset can be valuable to the research community. In the first use case, a random forest (RF) classifier is trained to distinguish power system disturbance signatures from data anomalies introduced in synchrophasor measurements due to clock errors. With optimally tuned class weights, the RF classifier achieves an F1 score of 0.999. The second use case studies the impact of data quality issues on an example synchrophasor application (specifically, event start time determination). It is found that the introduction of quantization noise and intermittent data anomalies can increase the root mean square error for event start time determination by 1-4 seconds. The use cases demonstrate how the repository curated in this work can be valuable for developing and testing tools aimed at analyzing synchrophasor measurements.",

        "title": "Dual Feature Fusion Tracking With Combined Cross-Correlation and Transformer",
        "abstract": "Siamese networks have found applications in various fields, notably object tracking, due to their remarkable speed and accuracy. Siamese tracking networks rely on cross-correlation to obtain the similarity score between the target template and the search region. However, since cross-correlation is a local matching operation, it cannot effectively capture the global context information. While the Transformer for feature fusion can better capture long-range dependencies and obtain more semantic information, more localized edge information is needed to distinguish the target from the background. Cross-correlation fusion and Transformer fusion have their advantages. They can complement each other, so we combine them and propose a dual feature fusion tracker (SiamCT) to obtain the local correlations and global dependencies between the target and the search region. Specifically, we construct two parallel feature fusion paths based on cross-correlation and Transformer. Among them, for cross-correlation fusion, we adopt the more efficient two-dimension pixel-wise cross-correlation (TDPC), which performs correlation operations from both spatial and channel dimensions, and the interaction of multidimensional information helps to realize more accurate feature fusion. Subsequently, the fused features are augmented by coordinate attention (CA) for orientation-dependent positional information. For Transformer fusion, we introduce cos-based linear attention(ClA) to improve Transformer’s ability to acquire global context information. Our SiamCT outperforms existing leading methods in GOT-10k, LaSOT, TrackingNet, and OTB100 benchmarks based on extensive experiments. In particular, the AO score on the GOT-10k benchmark is 70.6%, and theSR0.5andSR0.75scores are 80.5%, 65.9%, respectively, achieving state-of-the-art performance.",

In order to achieve super-resolution reconstruction of images, a new algorithm combining traditional algorithms and deep learning is proposed. The framework is divided into two parts. Firstly, the deep reconstruction of the low-resolution data is performed by the ability of deep learning to extract features automatically. Then, combining with the traditional interpolation reconstruction results, the deep learning algorithm is used again for training and learning, and finally the high-resolution reconstructed data is obtained. The algorithm is validated using an online public test data set. The results show that the algorithm has a significant effect on the MSE (mean squared error) and PSNR (Peak Signal to Noise Ratio). Compared with the traditional interpolation algorithm and the single deep learning algorithm, the proposed algorithm has higher performance. Moreover, the proposed algorithm is perfect for the reconstruction of the details, the outline is clear, and the high-quality image is obtained.",

        "abstract": "Initially appearing as an abstract object frequently used in math and physics, tensors have been attracting increasing interest in a broad range of research fields, such as engineering and data science. However, a few studies have addressed their application in wireless scenarios. In this paper, we investigate the wide applications of tensor techniques with an emphasis on the tensor voting method, which serves as an artificial intelligence approach for automatic inference and perceptual grouping. To illustrate the efficiency of the tensor voting approach, we tackle the tracking problem of inferring human mobility traces, which can provide key location information of networking objects. The trace inferring problem is considered under the circumstance that the recorded location information exhibits missing data and noise. Based on the tensor voting theory, we propose a sparse tensor voting algorithm and an implementation scheme with computational efficiency. The model is constructed based on the geometric connections between the input signals and encodes the structure information in the tensor matrix. The missing location information and noise can be distinguished via tensor decomposition. Once the trace information has been completed, further analysis of the inferred trace can be performed based on feature extraction to differentiate different objects. Moreover, we propose several feature extraction methods to characterize the inferred trace, including the scale invariant feature obtained from the fractal analysis. The proposed methods for trace completion and pattern analysis are applied to real human mobility traces. The results show that our proposed approach effectively recovers human mobility trace from the incomplete and noisy data input, and discovers meaningful patterns of inferred traces from various objects.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a new, compact, high-coding-capacity resonator suitable for applications in chipless RFID tags. These tags consist of multiple resonators and two cross-polarized ultra-wide band antennas. Each resonator contains a U-shaped coupled microstrip frame with isolated (K-1) legs inside. One of the legs is designed to be connected to the U-frame via a metallic strip in order to adjust its resonance frequency. Using this feature, the frequency of each resonator can be reconfigured to be equal to one of the K-resonance frequencies. Therefore, each resonance presents one of the K-states of the resonator. This allows each resonator to represent more than one bit of information; this arrangement also permits N resonators tags to provide KNcodes. The structure can store large volumes of data in a small area and can simplify the detection process by only reading N resonance frequencies for each code. When N resonator tags are used in the proposed structure, the amount of data that can be encoded increases to 2(logK/log2)Ncompared to 2Nin the case of conventional one-bit resonator (2-states) tags. An additional arrangement is also proposed and investigated in order to improve the spectral efficiency by allowing the bandwidth of each single resonator to be shared between two resonators. Several tags for codes with K = 8 are designed and implemented on the RT Duroid 5880 substrate as a proof-of-concept. An 8-state of the proposed resonator can be implemented in an area that is almost the same size as the area of a conventional 2-state resonator operating at 5 GHz. A satisfactory agreement between the empirical and simulated results is then confirmed.",

Specifically, in the first stage, an improved weighted Gerschgorin disk identifier is developed to obtain the number of transmit antennas using frequency domain signals. In the second stage, we first derive an equivalent time-domain model to improve the utilization of the receiver antenna, and then a novel test statistic followingFdistribution is constructed to perform the sequential binary hypothesis testing. Finally, the channel order is obtained using the estimated number of transmit antennas in the first stage.

        "abstract": "Spiking neural network models characterize the emergent collective dynamics of circuits of biological neurons and help engineer neuro-inspired solutions across fields. Most dynamical systems’ models of spiking neural networks typically exhibit one of two major types of interactions: First, the response of a neuron’s state variable to incoming pulse signals (spikes) may be additive and independent of its current state. Second, the response may depend on the current neuron’s state and multiply a function of the state variable. Here we reveal that deterministic spiking neural network models with additive coupling are equivalent to models with multiplicative coupling for simultaneously modified intrinsic neuron time evolution. As a consequence, the same collective dynamics can be attained by state-dependent multiplicative and constant (state-independent) additive coupling. Such a mapping enables the transfer of theoretical results between spiking neural network models with different types of interaction mechanisms and at the same time extends the option space for hardware implementation or modeling. By allowing to choose the coupling type or neuron type that is the simplest one to implement in a given practical situation where a specific dynamic or functionality is required, it potentially allows simpler or more effective engineering applications.",

Schmitt trigger is used extensively in both the analogue and digital areas. The transfer characteristics of the proposed design are independent on the supply voltage. Unlike Schmitt triggers incorporating other types of amplifiers, the proposed design is totally active. It does not require passive resistors and hence it shall be more attractive for VLSI implementation. The proposed circuit is utilized to implement a novel current mode square-wave oscillator using a single current amplifier that provides differential current signals. The output amplitude can be controlled without additional circuitry. Current generators are particularly essential for bio-impedance measurement. Comparison with their counterparts using the operational amplifier, transconductance operational amplifier, transresistance operational amplifier, and current conveyor demonstrates several advantageous features of the proposed circuits. The experimental results obtained from primary prototypes fabricated using standard 150 nm CMOS process are provided. It is shown that the proposed Schmitt trigger and the square wave generator nominally consume 8 μW and 11 μW while working in the MHz range.",

To evaluate a prostate cancer, the most widespread rank is the so-called Gleason score, based on the microscopic cancer appearance. Once assigned to the diagnosed prostate cancer its relative Gleason score, the correct therapy to be adopted must be promptly defined. To support pathologists and radiologists in timely diagnosis, in this paper we propose a method aimed to infer the Gleason score and the prostate cancer therapy exploiting formal methods. We consider a set of radiomic features directly obtained from magnetic resonance images. For this reason the proposed method is non invasive, since it does not require a biopsy. We model magnetic resonance images of patients as timed automata networks and we assign the Gleason score and the relative treatment, exploiting a set of temporal logic properties. In the experimental analysis, the properties are verified on 36 different patients, confirming the effectiveness of the proposed method with a sensitivity and a specificity equal to 1 for all the evaluated cases in Gleason score inference, and a sensitivity equal to 0.94 and a specificity equal to 1 in treatment prediction.",

        "abstract": "In software development, stakeholders of the same project often collaborate asynchronously through shared artifacts. A traceability system links a project's artifacts and therefore provides support for collaboration among stakeholders. Different stakeholders are interested in different types of traceability links. The literature often states that traceability is useful but expensive to build and maintain. However, there is no study showing reduction in effort when traceability links among various software artifacts are provided and used during the maintenance phase. This paper presents a study evaluating the benefits of using traceability among requirements, design, code, code inspections, builds, defects, and tests artifacts in the maintenance phase. Before the study, a survey was conducted at a large industrial firm to determine the type of links that different stakeholders are interested in. Twenty-five stakeholders from this firm participated in a survey to define the type of traceability links that were of interest to them. With this result, a traceability link model is proposed that categorizes different types of traceability links based on stakeholders' roles. This link model was used in the study. Twenty-eight subjects from industry and academia participated in the empirical study that was conducted after the survey. A prototype link-tracing tool, TraceLink, was developed and used in the study to present traceability links to the experimental group, whereas the control group was not given any links to solve the tasks. Five maintenance tasks were used in the study. The results show a significant improvement in task accuracy (86.06%) when traceability links were given to the subjects. In conclusion, a traceability model based on an industrial survey provided traceability views that are based on stakeholders' roles. This empirical study provides evidence that traceability links are effective in solving maintenance tasks with higher accuracy.",

        "abstract": "The router's buffer accommodates transient packets to guarantee that the network's links do not become idle. However, buffer overflow causes packet loss, which is a signal of congestion. In content centric networking (CCN), the interest packet, which is used for requesting content, may be dropped due to such congestion. Each interest packet is assigned a specific lifetime, and when the lifetime expires without obtaining the requested content, the consumer needs to resend the Interest. However, waiting for the expiration of an Interest's lifetime for retransmission is only appropriate for best effort traffic rather than services that are delay sensitive. In order to provide delay-sensitive applications with better quality of service, we propose a congestion control mechanism for CCN, in which, we prevent congestion before it happens through monitoring buffer size. Upon reaching the buffer threshold, the node notifies its downstream node. On receiving the notification, the downstream node adjusts traffic rate by allocating new incoming Interests to other face(s). However, when the downstream node fails to reduce traffic rate, the same procedure continues until the consumer node reduces sending rate. The simulation results show that the proposed mechanism is capable of significant performance improvements, with higher throughput.",

This paper addresses three main problems: 1) how to increase the computational and energy efficiency of computers and to reduce their size and weight; 2) how to achieve human-like versatility in intelligence; and 3) likewise for human-like adaptability in intelligence. Regarding the first problem, the SP system has the potential for substantial gains in computational efficiency, with corresponding cuts in energy consumption and the bulkiness of computers: 1) by reducing the size of data to be processed; 2) by exploiting statistical information that the system gathers as an integral part of how it works; and 3) via a new version of Donald Hebb's concept of a cell assembly. Toward human-like versatility in intelligence, the SP system has strengths in unsupervised learning, natural language processing, pattern recognition, information retrieval, several kinds of reasoning, planning, problem solving, and more, with seamless integration among structures and functions. The SP system's strengths in unsupervised learning and other aspects of intelligence may help in achieving human-like adaptability in intelligence via: 1) one-trial learning; 2) learning of natural language; 3) learning to see; 4) building 3-D models of objects and of a robot's surroundings; 5) learning regularities in the workings of a robot and in the robot's environment; 6) exploration and play; 7) learning major skills; and 8) learning via demonstration.

The originality of our approach is twofold. First, it is based on a new dynamic encoding (DE) which takes advantage of variable-length DNA codewords to encode binary data while avoiding homopolymers longer than N bases. Second, DE is combined with a sliding window strategy to detect whether a prohibited motif is about to appear. In such cases, our method inserts a non-coding base into the sequence to prevent the encoding of the motif. Unlike existing schemes, our approach scales extremely easily for high values of homopolymers and of prohibited motifs. It is furthermore independent of the cryptosystem. We provide the theoretical information rate of our proposal for a given number of prohibited motifs and a maximum homopolymer length. In general, it offers significantly higher performances, particularly in terms of information rate, than existing schemes while maintaining G-C content within the desired range with extremely high probability. Moreover, experiments conducted with a recent DNA storage chain simulator show that our method requires a similar amount of sequence copies as other encoding strategies for error-free DNA sequence recovery.",

The use of symmetry and Boolean difference notably reduces the search space and speeds up the Boolean matching process compared with the algorithm proposed by Adbollahi and Pedram. We tested our algorithm on a large number of circuits. The experimental results showed that the average runtime of our algorithm 37% higher and its average search space 67% smaller compared with Adbollahi and Pedram, when tested on general circuits.",

        "abstract": "Research on Compressive Sensing (CS) framework for ECG signals are of 3 categories. Category 1) involves CS for a single frame of ECG signal and performance analysis of reconstructed frame. Category 2) involves CS for every frame of the complete ECG signals and arrhythmia classification using deep learning approach on the reconstructed ECG signals. Category 3) is same as category 1) but the classification involves direct compressed measurements without reconstruction. The key merit of category 2) is that the signal can also be visually inspected by doctors. This paper falls in category 2) and proposes a hybrid CS algorithm for ECG signal reconstruction using discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and discrete cosine transform (DCT) both as sensing and sparsifying operator and the classification of reconstructed signal is achieved using DCNN for two different image representations (a) CWT and (b) STFT. Using MIT-BIT ECG dataset, for the proposed hybrid CS implementation the reconstruction is achieved with PRD=2.591, SNR=36.530dB and SSIM=0.745587 and the classification accuracy achieved for binary class problem with CR=0.5 is 93% for CWT image representation and 98.4% for STFT image representation. The proposed hybrid CS method performs better than the conventional non hybrid method for all the performance metrics and the classification results are better than other existing state of art methods for category 2) & 3). The same experiment is extended to a 3-class DCNN classification problem and the accuracy is 93.33% for the STFT image.",

        "title": "Are Children More Exposed to Radio Frequency Energy From Mobile Phones Than Adults?",
        "abstract": "There has been long-standing controversy, both among scientists and in the public, about whether children absorb more radio frequency (RF) energy in their heads than adults when using a mobile telephone. This review summarizes the current understanding of this issue, and some of the complexities in comparing the absorption of RF energy in different individuals from use of mobile phones. The discussion is limited to dosimetric issues, i.e., possible age-related differences in absorption of RF energy in the heads of mobile phone users. For most metrics of exposure, in particular those relevant to assessing the compliance of handsets with regulatory limits, there is no clear evidence for age-related differences in exposure. For two metrics of exposure, there is a clear evidence that age can play a factor: 1) the local specific absorption rate (SAR), in particular anatomically defined locations within the brain, will vary with head size and hence with age and 2) the SAR, in particular tissues, (e.g., bone marrow in the skull) can vary with age due to age-related differences in the dielectric properties of tissue. However, these differences involve SAR levels that are below the 1-g or 10-g peak spatial SAR (psSAR averaged over 1 or 10 g of tissue) and have no significance for compliance assessment. Age-related differences observed in worst case simulations such as presently considered are difficult to generalize to human populations under real-world exposure conditions due to many variables that determine SAR during realistic usages.",

Ballistic resistance testing routinely employs sensitivity experiment techniques where sequential test designs are used to estimate a particular quantile of the probability of perforation. Statistical procedures used to estimate the ballistic resistance of armor in the DoD have remained relatively unchanged for decades. In the current fiscal atmosphere of sequestration and budget deficits, efficiency is critical for test and evaluation. In this paper, we review and compare sequential methods, estimators, and stopping criteria used in the DoD to those found in literature. Using Monte Carlo simulation, we find that the three-phase optimal design, a probit model, and a break separation stopping criteria are most accurate and efficient at estimating V50, while the three-phase optimal design or Robbins-Monroe-Joseph method should be used to estimate V10.",

        "abstract": "User-based collaborative filtering is an important technique used in collaborative filtering recommender systems to recommend items based on the opinions of like-minded nearby users, where similarity computation is the critical component. Traditional similarity measures, such as Pearson's correlation coefficient and cosine Similarity, mainly focus on the directions of co-related rating vectors and have inherent limitations for recommendations. In addition, CF-based recommendation systems always suffer from the cold-start problem, where users do not have enough co-related ratings for prediction. To address these problems, we propose a novel similarity measure inspired by a physical resonance phenomenon, named resonance similarity (RES). We fully consider different personalized situations in RES by mathematically modeling the consistency of users' rating behaviors, the distances between the users' opinions, and the Jaccard factor with both the co-related and non-related ratings. RES is a cumulative sum of the arithmetic product of these three parts and is optimized using learning parameters from data sets. Results evaluated on six real data sets show that RES is robust against the observed problems and has superior predictive accuracy compared with the state-of-the-art similarity measures on full users', grouped users', and cold-start users' evaluations.",

Employing printed circuit board (PCB) microstrip filters is a promising approach as they offer a highly precise low-cost solution. In face of the specific requirements of the FI-ADC on the AAF amplitude response, the stepped impedance approach is shown to be much more suitable than other common approaches for wide stop band filters. The solution to neutralizing the spurious pass bands by placing them in the samplers’ mute frequency regions is introduced. Due to the high cutoff frequencies, typically beyond 8GHz, parasitics and lateral resonances become significant however. Hence, a novel compensation method is presented that integrates well with the required amplitude response, by reinterpreting the longitudinal low-Z-sections as individual lateral microstrips. To prove the proposed method, the design, simulation, and physical implementation of such AAFs are carried out in the context of a state-of-the-art beyond-20GS/s 7bit sub-ADC core and a baseband processing bandwidth of 7GHz. The measurement results confirm the behavior predicted by the analytical models and EM simulations, and therefore the suitability of the method for designing AAFs for FI-ADCs.",

In this article, we address the problem of group formulation in MCS, which aims to recruit highly trusted participants and form a high-reputation group. We propose a novel Privacy-preserving Trust-Aware Group Formation (PTAGF) framework that ensures trust and privacy between the group members. This framework consists of three mechanisms; the member trust assessment mechanism, the group forming mechanism, and the two-layer privacy-preserving mechanism. Furthermore, we prove that the group forming problem is NP-hard, and thus propose a heuristic-based Trust-Aware Group Formulation (TAGF) algorithm. A theoretical analysis is provided, which demonstrates that the proposed framework achieves privacy and security. Finally, we experimentally evaluate the performance of PTAGF on a real-world dataset against two state-of-the-art approaches. The results demonstrate that PTAGF outperforms these approaches in terms of trustworthiness in group selection. Moreover, it achieves reasonable task coverage and running time with different communities size, group sizes, and task scales.",

Both a single exemplar measure of information, separability, and its ensemble average equivalent, separation, are shown to measure the information support for decision quality (i.e., how well-informed is the decision), rather than the information support for decision adjudication (i.e., which hypothesis is the better choice) provided by predecision information measures. When compared to the traditional receiver operating characteristic, these measures present several functional advantages. They are scalar in nature, and may be directly optimized over secondary parameters, as well as being rigorously well posed and universally comparable. They incorporate the effects of all relevant decision components (prior information, observational information, and decision rule) in a unified manner while still being easily related to the predecision information measures of log likelihood ratio and generalized signal-to-noise ratio. They can be applied equally well to individual trials or composite averages, and evaluation does not require knowledge of the underlying truth. Compared to false alarm-oriented methods for assessing decision performance, their construction reduces sensitivity to tail effects in the underlying distributions.",

        "abstract": "Traditionally, industrial control systems (ICS) are closed structures that rely on specialized hardware and software with proprietary control protocols. However, with the advancement of technology and the digitalization of ICS, the attack space available to malicious actors has significantly expanded. Anomaly detection systems, initially implemented for detecting device faults or failures, have increasingly become the focus of research aimed at identifying attack patterns as cyberattack techniques become more sophisticated and intelligent. Many anomaly detection algorithms based on deep learning models have good performance but often involve complex neural network structures, creating a black-box issue where users cannot interpret the decisions made by the models. The black-box issue hinders the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) systems that can ensure efficient and secure operation in ICS environments. Various attempts have been made to address the black box issue but limited to identifying the features that caused the anomaly. In detecting target anomalies in industrial control system operational data, it is important not only to identify feature importance, but also to consider correlations between variables, and to provide intuitive explanations to enhance the understanding of operators. To satisfy these major values, this paper proposes a method for explainable anomaly detection for ICS.",

To highlight the fault impact signal representation, we use the exact energy operator to enhance the weak-impact components in the early fault signal. The proposed binary mechanism effectively distinguishes irrelevant features based on the adaptive decomposition parameter construction strategy. Therefore, interference features are easily removed from similar mixed signals, and the independent mode features are determined. The experimental results of the simulation and collected data are compared with those obtained with existing signal decomposition methods, and the superiority of the proposed method, owing to its better modal distinction and less time consumption, is verified.",

        "abstract": "Obtaining solutions to large-scale linear ordinary differential equations (ODEs) inevitably relies on numerical integration methods that have developed in various contexts to ultimately approximate the differentiation of continuous-time values using differences in discrete values. This approximation typically induces integration error, which we hypothesize as arising from the deviation of the characteristic roots from those of the original ODEs. Herein, this hypothesis was proved by numerical experiments on integration of undamped vibration equation, which yielded error amplification over long-term integration. We numerically integrated second-order single and eighth order multiple undamped vibrational equations using various formulas and analyzed the results both qualitatively and quantitatively. In the quantitative analysis, we estimated the transfer function from the integrated numerical solutions and compared its roots with those of the original equation. This approach revealed that the numerical solutions corresponded to the solution of the ODEs with roots different from those of the original ODE. For example, integrating a vibration equation with (roots)×(step width)=0±1i using the backward Euler method resulted in solutions of the ODE with (roots)×(step width) = –0.3466±0.7854i, which were the roots of damped vibration with a lower angular frequency than that of the original ODE. This phenomenon was clearly observed for an eighth-order vibrational ODE. As the product of the roots and step width decreases, the values approach the roots of the original ODE.",

The primary objective of the proposed method is to maintain normal voltage supply to the all phases while ensuring that zero voltage is applied to the faulted line during an LL fault. To achieve this, a new coordinate transformation method is introduced to accurately extract the magnitude of unbalanced three-phase voltages. The proposed coordinate transformation handles a three-dimensional (3-D) plane under LL fault, enabling conversion to a two-dimensional (2-D) plane via transformation along theγ- axis. This transformation remains effective even under LL fault, ensuring reliable voltage magnitude detection and control through the synchronous reference frame (SRF) transformation. Additionally, an SVPWM switching strategy tailored for fault conditions is developed. By analyzing the 3P4L inverter’s switching vector diagram, a specific combination of switching vectors is proposed to apply zero voltage to the faulted line. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is validated through experimental results from a 30 kW-class 3P4L inverter.",

        "abstract": "Among the discovered knowledge, sequential-pattern mining is used to discover the frequent subsequences from a sequence database. Most research handles the static database in batch mode to discover the desired sequential patterns. In the past, the fast updated (FUP) and Fast UPdated 2 (FUP2) concepts were adopted to, respectively, maintain and update the discovered sequential patterns with sequence insertion and sequence deletion based on the designed FUP sequential pattern (FUSP)-tree structure. Based on the FUP or FUP2 concepts, original customer sequences are required to be rescanned if it is necessary to maintain and update the unpromising (small) sequences from the original database. In the past, pre-large concept was designed to keep the prelarge itemsets as the buffer to avoid the database rescan each time whether transaction insertion or deletion in the dynamic databases. In this paper, the prelarge concept is adopted to handle the discovered sequential patterns with sequence deletion. An FUSP tree is first built to keep only the frequent 1-sequences from the original database. The prelarge 1-sequences are also kept in a set for later maintenance approach. When some sequences are deleted from the original database, the proposed algorithm is then performed to divide the kept frequent 1-sequences and prelarge 1-sequences from the original database and the mined 1-sequences from the deleted customer sequences into three parts with nine cases. Each case is then processed by the designed algorithm to maintain and update the built FUSP tree. When the number of deleted customer sequences is smaller than the safety bound of the prelarge concept, the original customer sequences are unnecessary to be rescanned, but the sequential patterns can still be actually maintained and updated. Experiments are conducted to show the performance of the proposed algorithm in terms of execution time and the number of tree nodes.",

        "abstract": "The quantum mechanical concept of an “atom in a molecule” is synthetically emulated and analyzed in the form of a nonlinear electronic circuit. The circuit is comprised of coupled quantized oscillators. Quantized oscillators are novel and not generally known. Such systems are shown to be consistent with quantum chemical dynamics. Such a network of quantized oscillators achieves equilibriums that are consistent with naturally occurring molecules. These capabilities offer an alternative to von Neumann digital based computations, whereby solutions to complex systems are determined as equilibriums, as is the case of nature. Historically, quantized solutions have been associated with solutions to Shrödinger’s Equation. Shrödinger Equation based observations are typically rendered, if possible, by numerical calculations. By comparison, the approach presented in this work relies on synthesizing quantized electronic devices, which are novel, in order to achieve dynamical interactions consistent with naturally occurring ones. Detailed dynamics based on actual devices are provided. The theoretical underpinnings are described. This topic has broad implications for a variety of concepts associated with quantum mechanics, including computations and entanglement, as well as various oscillator circuits of fundamental importance.",

        "abstract": "The deployment of heterogeneous networks (HetNets) can significantly boost the network capacity. However, the large number of small cell base stations (SBSs) deployed in HetNets can result in an increased total energy consumption. One of the promising techniques to reduce the energy consumption of networks is base station (BS) ON/OFF switching (sleeping) approaches. Due to device lifetime and energy waste by unnecessary switchings, the number of switchings is considered as an important problem. In this paper, we formulate the ON/OFF switching problem as a satisfaction game, where BSs seek to meet certain performance constraints in order to avoid the frequent BS switchings. Furthermore, BSs can choose their transmission power levels according to the network conditions in a distributed manner. The proposed satisfaction game involves a multi-step process. In the first step, we aim at satisfying the players with the high satisfaction threshold in a predefined time interval. To measure a BS's satisfaction, a utility function is used that includes BS's load and power consumption, in which the load of each BS is coupled with the load of other BSs. Since all players cannot be simultaneously satisfied, unsatisfied players decide to reduce their thresholds, and form a game with the redefined thresholds. To solve the game, a regret-based satisfaction algorithm and a satisfaction equilibrium search algorithm are applied. Simulation results show that the proposed schemes can achieve significant reductions in the number of switchings compared with the benchmark methods.",

        "abstract": "To address the current challenges in fire detection algorithms, including insufficient feature extraction, high computational complexity, limited deployment on resource-constrained devices, missed detections, false detections, and low accuracy, we developed a high-precision algorithm named GSF-YOLOv8. The GSF-YOLOv8 consists of three main parts: Firstly, we introduced the Gather-Distribute (GD) feature aggregation module, which enhances the recognition accuracy of fire features by fusing and extracting multi-scale information. Secondly, we integrated the SimAM attention module to optimize the collaborative learning of feature map dimensions and to reduce reliance on hyperparameter tuning through precise weight allocation, thereby improving the model’s rapid response capability to fires. Lastly, we proposed a Focal-DIoU Loss to replace the original loss function, optimizing bounding box regression and improving localization accuracy. It also focuses on hard samples to reduce the impact of easily misclassified samples, thereby enhancing the model’s performance in complex fire detection. We tested our method on the D-Fire dataset. The experimental results showed that GSF-YOLOv8 achieved higher mAP (80.65%) and faster detection speed (118 FPS). Meanwhile, the model’s complexity and number of parameters have been significantly optimized. The GSF-YOLOv8 not only significantly improves the efficiency and accuracy of fire detection but also provides a more reliable and accurate solution for real-time detection in similarly complex environments.",

The digital potentiometer controlled by the Arduino (microcontroller) was an improvement and was able to produce satisfactory results, as compared with the analog potentiometer without the Arduino control.

The image projections of the 3-D point on the 3-D reference are analyzed by the multiple view geometry. The Plücker coordinates of the two screw projection lines are constructed by the image points. The line segment perpendicular to two projection lines is generated from the direction vector and the end points of the line segment. As the bilinear products of the Plücker coordinates between the perpendicular line and the projection lines are zero, the end points of the perpendicular line segment are parameterized by the Cramer's Rule. The reconstruction error of the distance between two parameterized 3-D points is employed as the minimized objective of the cost function. The impact factors and the enhancements of the reconstruction accuracy are investigated by the experiments comparing with the original method. The method contributes the error descents of 27.19%, 38.29%, 19.01%,and 16.31% for the test lengths of 50, 100, 150, and 200 mm.

        "abstract": "We propose two algorithms based on local and global searches for a Task and Motion Planning (TAMP) problem, which considers a robotic manipulator to rearrange obstacles and grasp a target in clutter. In the problem, no collision-free path for a robotic manipulator is available unless some obstacles blocking a target are relocated. The two algorithms determine the sequence of obstacles to be removed for grasping a target without collisions. The local search algorithm determines the sequence quickly in an online manner but could be suboptimal in the number of removed obstacles. The global search algorithm based on tree search needs upfront computation but runs in polynomial time. In numerical simulation settings, we consider objects in various shapes, which could make reachable directions bounded. From the simulations the planning time of local search algorithm is faster than that of global search, whereas the global search algorithm removes the less number of obstacles than the local search. In addition, we show that the global search algorithm with a heuristic cost is faster than without the cost but the minimum number of removed obstacles is still obtained from the global search algorithm without the heuristic cost. Practical experiments show the applicability of our algorithms in real environments",

In this technical survey, we outline the main existing techniques for augmenting fMRI data, primarily represented as image, time series, and graph data. For each of these representations, we explore specific data augmentation methods. We provide a structured framework for understanding and comparing these principal fMRI data augmentation techniques. We define and summarize examples for each category, including image augmentation, time-series augmentation, graph augmentation, and additionally cover simulation and modeling approaches. For each main technique, we offer a general definition, discuss the technical details, and provide schematic illustrations. The final section provides a critical analysis of all methods, offering recommendations on which methods to use in different scenarios, and includes a comparative table of all techniques.

        "abstract": "Research related to vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) has received significant attention in recent years. Despite all the advantages, the security and privacy in VANETs still become the main challenge that is widely open to discussion. The authentication scheme plays a substantial role to guarantee the security and privacy of information circulation and verification efficiency in VANETs. In this high-density environment, a scalability issue would emerge when the number of message-signature pairs received by a roadside unit (RSU) or vehicles becomes large. This issue happens because those entities cannot sequentially verify each received signature according to the required time limit. Researchers believe that the symmetric cryptography-based authentication scheme provides a lightweight verification operation, which leads to low computation cost. Combined with the batch verification process, this approach can be beneficial. However, to the best of our knowledge, not many of those related schemes provide a realistic scenario regarding illegal signatures’ appearance. Could the system identify the forged messages? Is it still efficient enough to do such an operation? In this paper, we propose a lightweight binary tree-based (BT-based) authentication scheme with a batch verification mechanism, that could efficiently identify a modest amount of illegal signatures in the sum of messages. To even improve the operation, we combine our BT-based batch verification scheme with our vehicle reputation scoring system. By this approach, we can guarantee the best-case scenario (the most desirable condition) in our BT-based identification appear as much as possible. Hence, the computation cost can be kept low.",

To address that, we investigate a novel disruption resilient transport protocol (DRTP) enabling hop-by-hop retransmission utilizing the redundant subpaths (RSPs) available for the PP to increase reliability. It addresses the new distributed collaboration issue under multiple link failures to avoid cache mismatching. These have not been considered by the existing approaches.

By alternating the roles of the comparators and eliminating the need for an additional calibration cycle, the method achieves efficient calibration without the overhead of extra reference comparators. A prototype 8-bit SAR ADC implemented in a 28 nm CMOS LPP process demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed technique, achieving a measured SNDR of 44.3 dB and SFDR of 58.4 dB at 500 MS/s, with a power consumption of 1.13 mW.

In OFDM-IM, the information bits of a block are generally divided into several subblocks, each of which is further split into two parts, i.e., the index bits and the symbol bits. By performing a coordinate interleaving operation over each two constellation symbols, the bit-error-rate (BER) performance of the symbol bits is significantly improved in an existing OFDM-IM scheme, which is called coordinate-interleaved OFDM-IM (CI-OFDM-IM). In this paper, we propose a novel OFDM-IM scheme termed enhanced CI-OFDM-IM (ECI-OFDM-IM). In ECI-OFDM-IM, to improve the BER performance of the index bits, we adopt a special subcarrier-activation pattern (SAP) lookup table in which the Hamming distance of any pair of SAPs is at least four. To improve the BER performance of the symbol bits conveyed by the active subcarriers, the operations of rotating and coordinate interleaving are conducted twice over each four constellation symbols. Based on the maximum likelihood (ML) detection, a theoretical upper bound on the average bit-error probability of ECI-OFDM-IM is derived in closed form. By using the log-likelihood ratio method for SAP detection, a semi-ML detection scheme is proposed. Both the theoretical and simulation results show that ECI-OFDM-IM outperforms CI-OFDM-IM with additional diversity gains over frequency-selective Rayleigh fading channels.",

Hence, they should have the ability to interact with humans in a human-friendly manner. Humans prefer to use voice instructions, responses, and suggestions in their daily interactions. Such voice instructions and responses often include uncertain terms and lexical symbols rather than precise quantitative values. Therefore, the ability of robots to understand uncertain information is a crucial factor in the implementation of human-friendly interactive features in robots. This paper proposes a novel method of adapting the perception of the uncertain spatial information contents of navigational commands, such as “far” and “little”, based on environmental factors and user feedback. The proposed uncertain information understanding module has been implemented using fuzzy neural networks in such a way that the system can concurrently adapt to environmental factors while learning from user feedback.

This peculiar antenna holds the advantage of conventional metallic cavity-backed antennas, with high gain, high front-to-back ratio, and low cross-polarization level. SIW CBSA structures are the best option for planar integration with a low profile and low fabrication cost in the design of MMW systems. This paper discusses various forms of SIW CBSA structures, their operating mechanism, and methods of improving their performance in terms of gain, bandwidth, size reduction, beamforming capability, and multiple bands of operation. From this discussion, we can select the antenna with the required characteristics of gain, dual-band, and dual-polarization suited for present and future-generation applications.",

        "abstract": "Physical layer (PHY) security is recently regarded as a promising technique to improve the security performance of wireless communication networks. Current developments in PHY security are often based on the assumption of perfect channel state information (CSI). In this paper, both security and reliability performance for the downlink cloud radio access network with optimal remote radio heads (RRHs) node selection are investigated in a practical scenario by considering channel estimation (CE) errors. In particular, a three-phase transmission scheme is proposed and the linear minimum mean-square error (MMSE) estimation method is utilized to obtain the CSI. Based on the CSI estimates and the statistics of CE errors, the outage probability and intercept probability are derived in closed-form expression to evaluate the security and reliability performance, respectively. In addition, two possible cases (with or without intercepting signals from baseband unit) are considered for the eavesdropper. It is found that the suggested optimal RRHs selection scheme outperforms the nonselection scheme, and that the increasing number of RRHs can lower the outage probability as well as the intercept probability. It is also shown that there exists an optimal training number to minimize the sum of the outage probability and intercept probability. Finally, simulation results are provided to corroborate our proposed studies.",

        "abstract": "In seismic data processing, interpolation, super-resolution, and denoising are three key issues to improve data quality. While deep learning methods have successfully addressed one or two of these tasks, simultaneously resolving all three within a single network faces difficulties. These include conflicting objectives and complex network design. This paper proposes a heterogeneous knowledge distillation architecture comprising a teacher network (TNet) and a student network (SNet). TNet implements super-resolution and denoising tasks, while SNet implements interpolation task. This separation avoids goal conflicts between the networks. SNet retains TNet’s structure but reduces channels by half, simplifying both architectures. SNet combines data consistency loss and distillation loss. The data consistency loss integratesℓ1and multi-scale structural similarity. The distillation loss employs synchronous positive-negative learning. Consequently, SNet inherits TNet’s capabilities and further refines them during optimization. For comparison, we combine three interpolation algorithms with three super-resolution algorithms and select the one with the best performance. Experimental results on four field data show the superiority of our method over the counterpart in terms of data quality at a lower computational cost.",

        "abstract": "The uncertainties and disturbances in the actual driving conditions of hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) complicate the design of energy management strategy (EMS). To achieve better EMS performance for a battery-supercapacitor HEV, this paper proposes an improved and adaptive deep learning-based velocity prediction control EMS that can prolong the battery lifetime through efficient utilization of both the battery and supercapacitor. First, feature engineering techniques are used to extract and increase the key features from the historical driving cycle data of known driving conditions. With the extracted features, an improved long short-term memory (LSTM) velocity predictor was developed to predict future driving cycles for a real-time EMS under an unknown driving condition. Second, a real-time EMS based on the rule-based framework optimized with a neural network is proposed to optimize the power allocation online. Simulation results show that the proposed strategy smoothens battery peak power (i.e. prolongs battery life span) by approximately 26.85% on average and increases supercapacitor participation in the EMS, as evidenced by its increased energy throughput. Furthermore, compared with other EMS approaches, the proposed strategy improved the efficiency by significantly reducing total energy losses by approximately 22.25%. These results validate the reliability and robustness of the proposed strategy.",

        "abstract": "Automatic detection of plant diseases has emerged as a challenging field in the last decade. Computer vision-based advancements have helped in the timely and accurate identification of diseases, making possible an appropriate treatment and hence ensuring an increased yield. Diseases attack in different formations on a plant; the most severe being multiple diseases appearing on a single leaf. Moreover, as various diseases progress, they generate similar-looking symptoms making the task of identification further difficult. This work addresses these two problems with the help of an improved YOLOX model. We propose a modified Spatial Pyramid Pooling (SPP) layer to effectively extract relevant features at various scales from the training data. It is achieved by concatenating multilevel features pooled from smaller to larger scales. To enhance the generalization capability of the design, various skip connections are also introduced. To improve the network convergence and detection accuracy,αIoUbased regression loss function was employed. A dataset composed of 1, 112 cotton plant images with co-occurring diseases along with their progressive severity levels was collected from the Southern Punjab region of Pakistan. Apart from healthy images, the dataset comprises three severity stages of cotton leaf curl with co-occurring cotton sooty mold stress on a single leaf image. Experimental results revealed that our proposed improved SPP-based YOLOX-s model achieved 73.13% mAP on our self-collected dataset and achieved 3.27% better test accuracy than the original YOLOX model.",

This paper focuses on the design of precoding and receiving schemes for downlink multi-user multiple-input multiple-output VLC systems using angle diversity receivers. Two major concerns need to be considered while solving such a problem. The first one is related to the inter-user interference, basically inherent to our consideration of a multi-user system, while the second results from the users' mobility, causing imperfect channel estimates. To address both concerns, we propose robust precoding and receiver that solve the max-min SINR problem.

Efficient and effective emergency response planning within power utilities, other utilities dependent on electric power, private companies, and local, state, and federal government agencies benefit from accurate estimates of the extent and spatial distribution of power outages in advance of an approaching hurricane. A number of models have been developed for predicting power outages in advance of a hurricane, but these have been specific to a given utility service area, limiting their use to support wider emergency response planning. In this paper, we describe the development of a hurricane power outage prediction model applicable along the full U.S. coastline using only publicly available data, we demonstrate the use of the model for Hurricane Sandy, and we use the model to estimate what the impacts of a number of historic storms, including Typhoon Haiyan, would be on current U.S. energy infrastructure.",

        "abstract": "Portfolio management is essential to reduce risks and maximize profits. It can be classified into two processes: stock selection and allocation. Stock selection identifies stocks with high expected profits, whereas stock allocation determines the investment ratios for the selected stocks. Most current stock selection methods employ a ranking approach that predicts a ranked stock list based on the relations between stocks. However, the ranking-based stock selection methods do not consider the stock allocation problem. Furthermore, the methods use either simple graphs or hypergraphs, but not both. The sole use of simple graphs or hypergraphs induces information loss as the collective or pairwise relations, respectively, are disregarded. To overcome these issues, we propose a novel portfolio management framework called ASA that combines ranking models with classification and regression models for autonomous stock selection and allocation. For stock selection, the simple graph- and hypergraph-based ranking models are hybridized for relational modeling to select the most profitable stocks. For stock allocation, the classification and regression models are combined to determine the investment ratio. Furthermore, ASA extracts robust features using hierarchical clustering, feature selection, and dimensionality reduction, following which it captures temporal information using long short-term memory (LSTM), bidirectional LSTM, and the Hawkes attention mechanism. The performance of ASA is compared with that of deep learning-based state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results for stocks included in the Standard & Poor’s 500 index demonstrate that ASA achieves a compounded annual growth rate of 58.2%, which is 39.1%P higher than that of the second-best performing method.",

To address these risks, this study establishes an innovative dual evaluation system combining static and dynamic methods to assess accident-inducing potential and risk propagation capability. Based on accident investigation reports from 2015 to 2022, a risk network with 82 nodes and 244 edges was constructed. Two static indicators—Target Oriented Centrality (TOC) and Accident Neighbor Risk Rate (ANRR)—were used to evaluate accident-inducing potential, while risk propagation capability was dynamically simulated using the Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered-Susceptible (SIRS) model, with Average Peak Infection Proportion (APIP) and Infection Cycle (APIC) as key metrics. Risk nodes were categorized into four clusters using spectral clustering, which was selected after comparing multiple algorithms with the Calinski-Harabasz (CH) index. Nodes were prioritized into three tiers based on accident-inducing potential and risk propagation capabilities. Results show that Tier 1 nodes (personnel and equipment) exhibit the highest accident-inducing potential, while Tier 2 nodes (management) play significant roles in risk propagation. Tier 3 nodes (environment) have limited direct impacts but may pose long-term risks. This system provides actionable insights to prioritize safety interventions, offering a robust framework for enhancing apron safety.",

The proposed strategy is fully distributed. Every node estimates the average SoC of all battery energy storage systems(BESSs) in a microgrid and determines the power of the local BESS and microturbine (MT) autonomously to achieve SoC balancing and economic dispatch with component constraints and power balance constraints by peer-to-peer communication with its neighbors. To improve the effectiveness of power distribution, an improved average consensus algorithm(IACA) based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) is proposed to adjust the weight matrix of communication networks, which reduces the number of iterations to estimate the average SoC. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed strategy can achieve SoC balance and have lower costs than traditional distributed economic power sharing strategy.",

        "abstract": "In binary classification, two-way confusion matrices, with corresponding measures, such as sensitivity and specificity, have become so ubiquitous that those who review results may not realize there are other and more realistic ways to visualize data. This is, particularly, true when risk and reward considerations are important. The approach suggested here proposes that classification need not offer a conclusion on every instance within a data set. If an algorithm finds instances (e.g., patient cases in a medical data set) in which attributes pertaining to a patient's disease offer zero to nil information, there should be no classification offered. From the physician's perspective, disclosure of nil information should be welcome because it might prevent potentially harmful treatment. It follows from this that the developer of a classifier can provide summary results amendable for helping the consumer decide whether or not it is prudent to pass or act (commission versus omission). It is not always about balancing sensitivity and specificity in all cases, but optimizing action on some cases. The explanation is centered on John Kelly's link of gambling with Shannon information theory. In addition, Graham's margin of safety, Bernoulli's utiles, and Hippocratic Oath are important. An example problem is provided using a Netherlands Cancer Institute breast cancer data set. Recurrence score, a popular molecular-based assay for breast cancer prognosis, was found to have an uninformative zone. The uninformative subset had been grouped with positive results to garner higher sensitivity. Yet, because of a positive result, patients might be advised to undergo potentially harmful treatment in the absence of useful information.",

        "abstract": "This study introduces a novel end-to-end framework designed to optimize patient outcomes and operational efficiency in intensive care units (ICUs) through fairness-aware and accurate length of stay (LOS) predictions within an IoT-enabled environment. Motivated by the concept of “fairness through unawareness,” our proposed framework employs a demographic feature exclusion strategy, preventing access to potentially discriminatory information, and thus enforcing an inductive bias that redirects learning toward non-discriminatory pattern dependencies. To address the loss of static information, we introduce a custom graph neural network that dynamically reconstructs patient relationships over time, adapting from static demographics to evolving inter-patient correlations via multi-modal embeddings (e.g., medications, procedures, vitals, conditions) and learned feature-driven edge formation. We evaluate our approach on MIMIC-IV across diverse time-series formats and demonstrate its superiority over top performing LOS prediction methods, showcasing notable performance improvements while maintaining comparable computational complexity. Additionally, we present a performance analysis highlighting our approach’s computational and predictive scalability across different graph sizes at inference, while underscoring its intrinsic ability to improve performance when deprived of demographic features by dynamically readjusting its expressive power, unlike all evaluated methodologies in this study. Finally, we present a comparative study against the literature’s top-performing LOS prediction approaches that highlights our method’s predictive superiority, demonstrating significant performance gains in predicting LOS exceeding 3 and 7 days, with improvements of up to 13.1% AUC and 10.3% ARP, and 14.1% AUC and 42.0% ARP, respectively.

        "abstract": "A data-driven generalization of the crossover model is proposed, characterizing the human control of systems with both integer and fractional-order plant dynamics. The model is developed and validated using data obtained from human subjects operating in compensatory and pursuit tracking tasks. From the model, it is inferred that humans possess a limited but consistent capability to compensate for fractional-order plant dynamics. Further, a review of potential sources of fractionality within such man-machine systems suggests that visual perception, based on visual cues that contain memory, and muscular dynamics are likely sources of fractional-order dynamics within humans themselves. Accordingly, a possible mechanism for fractional-order compensation, operating between visual and muscular subsystems, is proposed. Deeper analysis of the data shows that human response is more highly correlated to fractional-order representations of visual cues, rather than directly to objective engineering variables, as is commonly proposed in human control models in the literature. These results are expected to underpin future design developments in human-in-the-loop cyber-physical systems, for example, in semi-autonomous highway driving.",

This rapid growth combined with millions of applications (apps) make smart phones a favorite means of communication among users. In general, the available contents on smart phones, apps, and Web, come in two versions: (1) free content that is monetized via advertisements (ads) and (2) paid content that is monetized by user subscription fees. However, the resources, namely, energy, bandwidth, and processing power, on-board are limited, and the existence of ads in Web sites and free apps can significantly increase the usage of these resources. These issues necessitate a good understanding of the mobile advertising eco-system and how such limited resources can be efficiently used. In this paper, we present the results of a novel Web browsing technique that adapts the Web pages delivered to smart phone, based on the smart phone's current battery level and the network type. Web pages are adapted by controlling the amount of ads to be displayed. Validation tests confirm that the system can extend smart phone battery life by up to 30% and save wireless bandwidth up to ~44%.",

Most people’s daily activities are dependent on their ability to navigate the internet to access and manage information. There are usually real risks associated with managing or accessing information, and these risks when exploited by threat actors, often lead to cybersecurity incidents. It is a common knowledge that a major cybersecurity incident is likely to result in significant financial losses, legal liability, privacy violations, reputational damage, sensitive data compromises, as well as national security implications. Threat actors usually employ various attack techniques to cause these incidents. After we identified the major cybersecurity incident report that is consolidated by the Center for Strategic & International Studies (CSIS) from which we derived the data of about the 803 major incidents that we analyzed, we then verified its (CSIS) credibility, non-partisan, global outreach and cybersecurity attack coverage by cross-referencing it with Data Breach Investigation Report (DBIR). We also through the lens of the Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI) ensured that this study is conducted within the context of cybersecurity principles. In reference to these attack techniques employed by threat actors, we conducted an exploratory investigation of 803 major cybersecurity incidents that were reported over the last decade. From a group of 244 of these major security incidents that happened and were reported between 2005 and 2021, this study reports that malware attack techniques were employed by threat actors to cause 48 percent of them and phishing attack techniques account for 19.7 percent of them.

This work experimentally investigates a complementary setup to classical MFL approach, useful for detection of a thin steel thickness variations from 0.7 mm up to 3.5 mm, while using a light low cost Hall sensor array setup built with accessible off-the-shelf components. Instead of the horseshoe magnet moved simultaneously with the detectors, this work uses small strong magnets tiled together and static as referred to the sensor array’s scanning movement.

        "abstract": "In this paper, we consider the resource allocation problem for uplink non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) networks whose users represent power-restricted but high priority devices, such as those used in sensor networks supporting health and public safety applications. Such systems require high reliability and robust resource allocation techniques are needed to ensure performance. We examine the impact on system and user performance due to residual cancellation errors resulting from imperfect successive interference cancellation (SIC) and apply the chance-constrained robust optimization approach to tackle this type of error. In particular, we derive an expression for the user outage probability as a function of SIC error variance. This result is used to formulate a robust joint resource allocation problem that minimizes user transmit power subject to rate and outage constraints of critical applications. As the proposed optimization problem is inherently non-convex and NP-hard, we apply the techniques of variable relaxation and complementary geometric programming to develop a computationally tractable two-step iterative algorithm based on successive convex approximation. Simulation results demonstrate that, even for high levels of SIC error, the proposed robust algorithm for NOMA outperforms the traditional orthogonal multiple access case in terms of user transmit power and overall system density, i.e., serving more users over fewer sub-carriers. The chance-constrained approach necessitates a power-robustness tradeoff compared with non-robust NOMA but effectively enforces maximum user outage and can result in transmit power savings when users can accept a higher probability of outage.",

Particularly, active research has been conducted in depression diagnosis, based on multi-modal approaches in deep learning technology, which enable utilization of various information through fusion of varied data types. This study proposes a four-stream-based depression diagnosis model consisting of Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) and convolutional neural networks (CNN), using speech and text data. One-dimensional features of audio signals are extracted using Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients and Gammatone Cepstral Coefficients, and two-dimensional features are extracted from Bark, equivalent rectangular bandwidth, and Log-Mel spectrograms, based on time-frequency transform. The extracted features are applied to Bi-LSTM and CNN-based transfer learning models. Word encoding was used for mapping of text to sequences with numeric indices, and word embedding used for representation of all words in numeric dense vectors. These were applied to Bi-LSTM and n-gram-based CNN models. Finally, an ensemble of the softmax values output from the four deep learning models was used to perform depression diagnosis, based on the proposed four-stream model. Using the proposed model, experiments were performed with the Extended Distress Analysis Interview Corpus Wizard of Oz depression database and other datasets. Experimental results showed improved performance by 10.7% to 11.9% over two-stream-based state-of-the-art methods. This demonstrates that the proposed model is effective for depression diagnosis.",

        "abstract": "Accurate and timely forest fire detection is critical for early warnings and effective wildfire containment, safeguarding both ecological systems and human lives. However, in the early stages of a fire, the flames are typically small, and the smoke often bears a close resemblance to mist or fog, which makes prompt and accurate detection difficult and frequently causing the loss of the optimal response window. To tackle this challenge, we present an enhanced single-stage object detector, that excels at identifying fires, especially in their nascent stages. First, we incorporate a contrast enhancement technique that leverages an atmospheric scattering model and entropy optimization to clarify the blurred smoke edges. Next, we integrate deformable convolutions into the original feature extraction module, enabling more effective capture of long-range dependencies and spatial relationships, thus improving multi-scale fire detection accuracy. Additionally, we introduce a novel Hybrid Spatial Pyramid Pooling (HSPP) structure, which uses parallel average and max pooling operations to enrich feature extraction, facilitating better recognition of small-scale early fires. Finally, we propose a Dynamic Channel Attention (DCA) module to adaptively optimize cross-channel interactions across multiple feature extraction layers, bolstering cross-scale feature representations. Extensive experimental results show that on the M4SFWD and FLAME public datasets, our method achieves a 1% improvement in both precision and recall compared to the SOTA methods, while reducing the number of parameters by about 40%, making it more suitable for practical application.",

These applications demand high network throughput that easily exceeds the capability of the low-power 802.15.4 radios most commonly used in today’s sensor nodes. To address this issue, this paper investigates an energy-efficient approach to supplementing an 802.15.4-based wireless sensor network with high bandwidth, high power, longer range radios, such as 802.11. Exploiting a key observation that the high-bandwidth radio achieves low energy consumption per bit of transmitted data due to its inherent transmission efficiency, we propose a hybrid network architecture that utilizes an optimal density of dual-radio (802.15.4 and 802.11) nodes to augment a sensor network having only 802.15.4 radios. We present a cross-layer mathematical model to calculate this optimal density, which strikes a delicate balance between the low energy consumption per transmitted bit of the high-bandwidth radio and low sleep power of the 802.15.4. Experimental results obtained using a wireless sensor network testbed reveal that our architecture improves the average energy per bit, time elapsed before the first node drains its battery, time elapsed before half of the nodes drain their batteries, and end-to-end delay by significant margins compared with a network having only 802.15.4.",

This research extracted twenty-seven features based on several well-known scientific functions, such as entropy, correlation, and energy, to identify two of the five main mental symptom clusters (psychomotor and disorganization). The most expressive features were selected according to four techniques based on the wrapper and filter methods, then examined using five classification techniques. Sixty different experimental models were executed for each dataset separately, based on various forms of data representation, feature selection techniques, and classification methods. In addition, fifteen multi-label experiments were performed to challenge the system’s proficiency in studying each group versus the other two groups (one versus the rest).

This allows us to increase the number of transmitted symbol streams, while using a deep-subwavelength arrangement of individual plasmonic nanotransmit/receive elements in which the spacing between the transmitters and/or the receivers is tens of times smaller than the wavelength. This exclusive benefit is achieved with the aid of the phenomenon of graphene plasmons, where graphene offers the extremely confined and low-loss plasmon propagation. Hence, the proposed graphene-based MIMO system is capable of combating the fundamental limitations imposed on the classic MIMO configuration.

One approach to solving this problem is temporarily sharing private base stations (BSs) installed by individuals or companies. A blockchain is considered a key technology for achieving secure sharing of private BSs. In the blockchain-based radio access network (B-RAN), user equipment (UE) and BS owners can make communication contracts using blockchains. The B-RAN enables UEs to temporarily and securely share private BSs autonomously in a multi-radio environment without needing a centralized control station. However, since the selection of an access BS and making a communication contract are autonomously decentralized, the number of UE accommodations in each BS may be biased, and the overall BS-utilization efficiency and fairness of provided downlink throughput may decrease. We propose an autonomous decentralized method for improving the fairness of downlink throughput and overall BS-utilization efficiency by controlling the BS offer price using blockchain ledger information. Simulation results indicate that when determining the access BS for each UE without taking into account the authentication delays, the proposed method improves the median downlink throughput by about 2.2 times, fairness index of downlink throughput by about 7.6 times, and overall BS-utilization efficiency by about 1.2 times that of a conventional method in a multi-radio environment. The proposed method also improves the median downlink throughput by about 2.6 times, fairness index of downlink throughput by about 4.9 times, and overall BS-utilization efficiency by about 1.07 times that of a conventional method in a single-radio environment.

        "abstract": "In current computed tomography (CT) architecture, both X-ray tubes and X-ray detectors are rotated mechanically around an object to collect a sufficient number of projections. This architecture has been shown to not be fast enough for patients with high or irregular heart rates. Furthermore, both X-ray beams and detectors of the current architecture are made wide enough, so that the entire object is covered in the lateral direction without data truncation. Although novel acquisition protocols have recently been developed to reduce a radiation exposure, the high radiation dose from CT imaging remains a heightened public concern (especially for cardiac CT). The current CT architecture is a major bottleneck to further increase the temporal resolution and reduce the radiation dose. To overcome these problems, we present an innovative stationary-sources rotating-detectors CT (SSRD-CT) architecture based on the three stationary distributed X-ray sources and three smaller rotating X-ray detectors. Each distributed X-ray source has ~ 100 distinctive X-ray focal spots, and each detector has a narrower width compared with the conventional CT detectors. The SSRD-CT will have a field-of-view of 200 mm in diameter at isocenter, which is large enough to image many internal organs, including hearts. X-rays from the distributed sources are activated electronically to simulate the mechanical spinning of conventional single-beam X-ray sources with a high speed. The activation of individual X-ray beam will be synchronized to the corresponding rotating detector at the opposite end. Three source-detector chains can work in parallel to acquire three projections simultaneously and improve temporal resolution. Lower full-body radiation dose is expected for the proposed SSRD-CT because X-rays are restricted to irradiate a local smaller region. Taken together, the proposed SSRD-CT architecture will enable ≤50-ms temporal resolution and reduce radiation dose significantly.",

        "abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) in the civil sector have recently evolved from being devices for recreational uses to becoming aircraft for professional uses. Professional applications of these devices require the aircraft to ship more and more complex sensors for reasons of safety in the event of failures. However, controlling all these systems is a challenge for flight controllers at the hardware and software levels. In this context, this work proposes a new aircraft real-time flight control system. The flight controller hardware is made up of two systems: a core board houses common sensor and flight devices; a flexible unit, isolated from body vibrations, houses redundant sensors to improve accuracy and reliability. The application functions are driven by the microcontroller running a new real-time operating system (RTOS) to better schedule works on limited computation power. To design a simplified RTOS for embedded systems, a hybrid scheduler (first-come-first-serve scheduling and earliest-deadline-first scheduling) with dynamic priority is proposed. The results obtained show the effectiveness of the system using schedulability tests for uni-processor systems. A set of real data supports the performance of the flight controller.",

Although deep learning models have demonstrated good performance in change detection tasks, they still face challenges when dealing with some complex scenes, such as possible insufficient feature extraction and pixel loss at the target edges. To overcome these problems, we propose a new model, StarCD-Net, that combines StarNet and differential operators, which uses StarNet for feature extraction and aggregates the extracted features by Multi-Layer Feature Aggregation Module (MLFA) to obtain rich information. To address the problem of loss of edge details, we design the Detailed Feature Enhancement (DFE) Module to enhance the feature edges. In addition, the Hierarchical Feature Fusion Module (HFF) fuses the current layer with deeper features to obtain the global semantic information of the change object. StarCD-Net was tested on three challenging remote sensing image datasets, and its F1 and IOU reached 91.48% and 84.3% in LEVIR-CD, respectively, and its F1 was 0.94% and 0.59% higher than the second place in WHU-CD and SYSU-CD, respectively, which is significantly better than other change detection techniques and shows quite an outstanding performance.",

Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technology is assumed to be equipped on the base station and nodes to improve communication performance and increase the whole network throughput. A wireless network is also set up, with a wired network of base stations to support the remote communication of wireless nodes. In order to overcome the inter-cell interference, the frequency reuse technology is adopted. Under the favorable propagation condition, MIMO significantly mitigates the effect of fading between the node antenna and the base station antenna. We first analyze the downlink outage throughput capacity in slow fading scenarios and get the close-form outage capacity. Then, we analyze the ergodic throughput capacity over fast fading channel and get the ergodic capacity in both low SNR and high SNR scenarios. Finally, the availability of MIMO technology is proved by computer simulation.",

However, most collaborative filtering algorithms suffer from data sparsity. Active learning algorithms are effective in reducing the sparsity problem for recommender systems by requesting users to give ratings to some items when they enter the systems. In this paper, a new matrix factorization model, called Enhanced SVD (ESVD) is proposed, which incorporates the classic matrix factorization algorithms with ratings completion inspired by active learning. In addition, the connection between the prediction accuracy and the density of matrix is built to further explore its potentials. We also propose the Multi-layer ESVD, which learns the model iteratively to further improve the prediction accuracy. To handle the imbalanced data sets that contain far more users than items or more items than users, the Item-wise ESVD and User-wise ESVD are presented, respectively. The proposed methods are evaluated on the famous Netflix and Movielens data sets. Experimental results validate their effectiveness in terms of both accuracy and efficiency when compared with traditional matrix factorization methods and active learning methods.",

In this paper, an algorithm of modified smooth patch ordering (MSPO) is proposed to improve the LDCT images. In the MSPO method, the non-local means (NLM) algorithm is modified by replacing the Leclerc robust function with the modified bisquare robust function, to serve as weight function for the estimate of each pixel value. Then, the modified NLM algorithm is combined with smooth ordering of the pixels, patch classification, and subimage averaging scheme to denoise the LDCT image. Additionally, the prewhitening of the LDCT image is carried out to enhance image denoising, and the total-variation filter is utilized as a post-processing step to further remove the residual noise of the recovered image. Subjective and objective evaluations on the actual thoracic phantom and clinical data are carried out for validating the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results from computer experiments demonstrate that the proposed MSPO approach performs better in both artifact suppression and structure preservation, when compared with several existing methods. Especially, the MSPO approach can be directly applied to process digital imaging and communications in medicine (DICOM) images, and has great potential in most current CT systems.",

The NOP sled requires that the code be executable and effectively “do nothing.” More specifically, “do nothing” means that the execution context is not disrupted to a point where the payload fails to execute. We enforce a zero-difference policy during validation for the components of the execution context we are analyzing. This paper uses the Ghidra reverse engineering tool to disassemble, emulate, and analyze a sequence of bytes to determine if they are an “effective NOP.” An effective NOP leaves the execution state unchanged after an arbitrary number of instructions. The execution state consists of a collection of registers and their values and a list of memory locations used. The proposed algorithm in this paper uses Ghidra to emulate instructions for NOP sleds and return a boolean true or false value based on the difference between the original and final execution context. The results from this paper are successful for the different types of constructed samples, polymorphic NOP sleds, and real-world data used to validate the artifact. We create an algorithm to calculate the differences between execution contexts, create an artifact to automatically process byte sequences to search for NOP sleds that satisfy our zero-difference policy, identify third-party NOP generators that did not produce NOP byte sequences that met this research’s standard and published the source code to an open-source repository.",

Individuals with ULEDs require assistive robots to fulfill all their activities of daily living (ADLs). Thus, this research presents an objective function for base placement optimization of assistive robots to increase the workspace required to fulfill ADLs (workspace coverage). The workspace coverage was determined using the xArm 6 robot and experimenting with different ADLs. Also, an object collision algorithm is implemented to avoid collisions between the robot and the user within the workspace. Moreover, the algorithm determines the existence of singularities within the workspace by computing the manipulability index. However, since the manipulability index computation depends on the Jacobian matrix’s eigenvalues yielding incongruences in the units, we divided the Jacobian matrix into two parts; one for the angular and another for the linear velocity. Finally, using the objective function with a genetic algorithm (GA), the optimal base placement for the robot is obtained and validated experimentally.",

Otherwise, stemming from a spectrum hole detection not corresponding to the terminal location, harmful interference to the primary network may occur. Non-cooperative spectrum sensing can inherently deliver accurate spectrum hole geolocation, as it corresponds to the position of the spectrum sensor. However, performance is degraded due to propagation-induced phenomena in the environment. While the performance of cooperative spectrum sensing is less prone to such phenomena, the accurate geolocation of the spectrum hole is compromised. This is because a vacant band is determined by a collective of spectrum sensors whose dispersed spatial distribution prevents from achieving high resolution concerning where in space the band is in fact vacant. This article delves into the problem of spectrum hole geolocation for DSA. As a solution, it is introduced a cooperative spectrum sensing scheme based on overlapped-clustering, integrated with a database-driven Internet of Things-enabled DSA framework. It is shown that the proposed solution achieves a high rate of correct estimations of spectrum hole geolocation, with small variance and under diverse system conditions.",

Deliberately clipping the transmission signal degrades system performance, and clipping mitigation is required at the receiver for information restoration.

The proposed scheme utilizes a priori information about the sparsity rate and noise variance for enhanced recovery. At the same time, the proposed scheme is robust against inaccurate estimates of the clipping signal statistics. The undistorted phase property of the clipped signal, as well as the clipping likelihood, is utilized for enhanced reconstruction. Furthermore, motivated by the nature of modern OFDM-based communication systems, we extend our clipping reconstruction approach to multiple antenna receivers and multi-user OFDM.We also address the problem of channel estimation from pilots contaminated by the clipping distortion. Numerical findings are presented that depict favorable results for the proposed scheme compared to the established sparse reconstruction schemes.",

To prepare for such a booming paradigm, IEEE 802.15.8 standardizes peer-aware communication (PAC) within the strict consideration of infrastructureless property and fully distributed coordination features. Since no central entity exists in a PAC network for control and management purposes, every PAC device (PD) plays an equal role in terms of communication. This situation leads to a variety of security challenges, especially in authentication and key agreement for lightweight IoT-enabled PDs. Recently, there are some proposals aimed at the aforementioned problems, such as approaches with personal identification number, physical layer features. However, due to its inconvenience and computational complexity for the lightweight IoT-enabled PDs, authentication and key agreement are still open issues in PAC. From this view, this paper proposes a new approach that utilizes social networking features closely tied to the PAC in order to support authentication and key agreement procedures. A number of trusted PDs are delegated to authenticate the requesting PD on behalf of the requested PD when an association is established between them. Intensive analysis and evaluation show that the proposed protocol provides multiple security levels as well as user convenience with reasonable resource consumption.",

However, with the increased demand for drones across a wide range of fields, their malicious use has also increased. Therefore, an anti-UAV system is required to detect unauthorized drone use. In this study, we propose a radio frequency (RF) based solution that uses 15 drone controller signals. The proposed method can solve the problems associated with the RF based detection method, which has poor classification accuracy when the distance between the controller and antenna increases or the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) decreases owing to the presence of a large amount of noise. For the experiment, we changed the SNR of the controller signal by adding white Gaussian noise to SNRs of −15 to 15 dB at 5 dB intervals. A power-based spectrogram image with an applied threshold value was used for convolution neural network training. The proposed model achieved 98% accuracy at an SNR of −15 dB and 99.17% accuracy in the classification of 105 classes with 15 drone controllers within 7 SNR regions. From these results, it was confirmed that the proposed method is both noise-tolerant and scalable.",

        "abstract": "The rational planning of territorial space is related to the speed of economic development and the protection of ecology. There is an urgent need for a more advanced integrated territorial space layout method. For additional spatial layout design, the study suggests a multi-objective genetic algorithm based on spatial data prediction and coupled with land simulation modeling in the context of big data and machine learning development. The innovation of the research lies in the optimization of the multi-objective genetic algorithm by improving the crossover and mutation process of genetic operators, enhancing the adaptability of the algorithm in dynamic environments, and improving the prediction accuracy of the spatial quantity structure of the national territory. The outcomes revealed that this approach was applied to the prediction of populations of different sizes 400 and 600 with an average accuracy of 67%, which was 17% higher than that of the traditional genetic algorithm. The difference between the predicted and actual future spatial population values using the proposed algorithm was less than 2%, which was 56.5% lower than the other two prediction algorithms on average. The proposed land simulation model reached the highest accuracy at 100 iterations with an average fitness of2.4×1011, which was 13% and 27% higher than the other two traditional neural network algorithms, respectively. In the two simple functions of f1 and f2, the highest convergence accuracy reached10−30and10−10, respectively. In the two more complicated functions of f3 and f4, the optimal solutions were approximated in the ranges of [102,1012] and [10−2,106] without significant fluctuations. Therefore, the proposed algorithm can effectively predict the number of territorial space in macro and micro simulation, and has high feasibility and accuracy. This provides a reliable basis for the government to carry out land resource planni...",

        "abstract": "We demonstrate a series of nonlinear, active, and tunable metasurfaces for a variety of electromagnetic applications. The metasurfaces have achieved a range of exotic properties by populating nonlinear or active circuit components on a periodically patterned metallic surface. The circuit components such as diodes, varactors, transistors, and other devices can be controlled manually, actively, or self-adaptively. This allows nonlinear metasurfaces to have active tuning, power-dependent behavior, self-focusing, reconfigurable surface topology, or frequency self-tuning capabilities. The power-dependent metasurfaces can be applied to active RF absorbers that only absorb high-power surface waves to prevent malfunction or damages to sensitive devices. The rectifier-based waveform-dependent metasurface absorber can be specifically designed to absorb either high power pulsed waves or continuous waves. The transistor-based surface wave metasurface absorber provides another degree of freedom in that it can be manually switched to tune the absorber, or it can be tuned using computer controlled feedback. The self-focusing effect has been demonstrated for the first time at RF frequencies to automatically collimate high-power surface waves. The reconfigurable and self-tuning metamaterial surfaces can be implemented to support a broadband reconfigurable antenna system or to adapt to a wide range of incoming frequencies. In this paper, the concepts of nonlinear and active tunable metasurfaces are discussed, including results of full-wave simulation analysis, EM/circuit co-simulation, and experimental results in waveguides, using a near-field scanner, as well as far-field measurements in an anechoic chamber.",

        "abstract": "Cardiovascular (CV) disorders and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) are very prevalent diseases worldwide. Multiple studies have demonstrated that OSA is associated with increased CV risk. Clinicians need to assess the CV risk to select the proper OSA treatment. A growing number of research have employed machine learning to predict CV risk by integrating clinical and sleep features. In this paper, a multiple input deep learning model was proposed to directly use sleep signals combined with clinical features. Data from 5,506 patients from the Pays de la Loire Sleep Cohort, without a history of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), investigated for OSA, were used. After a median follow-up of 6.0 years, 613 patients had been diagnosed with MACE according to the French national health system. Following an architecture selection, deep survival convolutional neural networks were computed to assess the MACE risk score. A custom loss function was integrated to consider the follow-up time of each patient. Based on the weights of each model input, a method for interpreting the model was also proposed to show the contribution of signals compared to clinical features. Sleep signals were extracted from a home sleep apnea test. The best results were obtained with the autonomic manifestation signal. An area under the ROC curve of 0.823 was reached. After interpretation of the models, consideration of sleep appeared to be more important in women and in those under 60. This method may help improve OSA patient care by estimating their risk of MACE during sleep diagnosis.",

        "abstract": "A depth camera-based novel method is proposed here for efficient facial expression recognition. For each pixel in a depth image, eight local directional strengths are obtained and ranked. Once the rank of all pixels is obtained, eight histograms are developed for the eight surrounding directions. The histograms are then concatenated to represent features for a depth image of a face. This approach is named local directional rank histogram pattern (LDRHP). To combine with LDRHP features, one more robust feature extraction technique named local directional strength pattern (LDSP) is proposed. Typical local directional pattern (LDP) considers only absolute values of edge strengths for a pixel. This generalization in LDP may generate the same patterns for two different kinds of edge pixels. LDSP can overcome this problem. It considers the binary values of the position with the directions representing the highest and lowest original strengths. The highest strength indicates the strongest direction on the bright side of a pixel and the lowest one indicates the strongest direction in the dark side of that pixel. Hence, combining binary positions of these two directions can generate more robust patterns than LDP. Besides, LDSP pattern of a pixel is of six bits, whereas traditional LDP-based patterns are of eight bits (e.g., local directional deviation-based pattern and local directional position pattern). Thus, LDSP reduces the dimension of features with the same time adding robustness. For a depth image in a depth video, LDSP features are augmented with LDRHP features followed by Kernel principal component analysis and generalized discriminant analysis to generate more robust features. At last, the features are trained with a deep learning approach and convolutional neural network for successful facial expression recognition. The proposed approach is compared and shown to outperform the traditional expression recognition methods.",

        "abstract": "Internet of things (IoT) networks connect sensing devices to the Internet for tasks like tracking, monitoring, and data analysis. However, the large data generated, especially in resource-heavy services, challenges energy efficiency (EE) and security. The use of intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS) in the physical layer security of IoT devices shows promise in improving secrecy performance and EE. This paper addresses IRS and AN-aided secure communication against eavesdroppers, where eavesdroppers are IoT devices equipped with simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) using power splitting policy. Our goal is to maximize secure EE, where the secure EE is defined as the secrecy rate over the power consumption of the user. We aim to jointly optimize phase-shift of IRS, transmit power of jammer and user, to maximize the objective function while ensuring that the secrecy rate is greater than the predefined threshold while allowing the eavesdroppers to harvest energy using SWIPT. We first formulate a joint optimization model of IRS and AN aided secure communication, which is a non-convex optimization problem with linear and non-linear constraints. To solve this problem, we propose a deep neural network (DNN) algorithm that utilizes a loss function derived from Lagrange duality function. The simulation results show that the proposed DNN achieves near-global optimal solutions. In addition, the results also prove the effectiveness of implementing IRS to enhance the secure EE of the user.",

Due to its complexity, the maritime industry suffers from a lack of trust and secure ownership evidence, protracted documentation procedures, and excessive data aggregation. These shortcomings are reflected in cargo processing delays and elevated costs in the shipping process. Most of today’s systems and technologies leveraged for managing shipping containers in unimodal and multimodal logistics fall short of providing transparency, traceability, reliability, audit, security, and trust features. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based solution that allows users to trace and track their container shipments in a manner that is decentralized, transparent, auditable, secure, and trustworthy. We employ the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) to overcome the limited data storage problem. We develop smart contracts and present algorithms along with their full implementation, testing, and validation details in both unimodal and multimodal logistics. We present security and cost analyses to show that the proposed solution is secure and cost-efficient. Furthermore, we compare our proposed solution with the existing solutions to show its novelty.

        "abstract": "This paper considers a downlink cloud radio access network (C-RAN) in which all the base-stations (BSs) are connected to a central computing cloud via digital backhaul links with finite capacities. Each user is associated with a user-centric cluster of BSs; the central processor shares the user's data with the BSs in the cluster, which then cooperatively serve the user through joint beamforming. Under this setup, this paper investigates the user scheduling, BS clustering, and beamforming design problem from a network utility maximization perspective. Differing from previous works, this paper explicitly considers the per-BS backhaul capacity constraints. We formulate the network utility maximization problem for the downlink C-RAN under two different models depending on whether the BS clustering for each user is dynamic or static over different user scheduling time slots. In the former case, the user-centric BS cluster is dynamically optimized for each scheduled user along with the beamforming vector in each time-frequency slot, whereas in the latter case, the user-centric BS cluster is fixed for each user and we jointly optimize the user scheduling and the beamforming vector to account for the backhaul constraints. In both cases, the nonconvex per-BS backhaul constraints are approximated using the reweighted ℓ1-norm technique. This approximation allows us to reformulate the per-BS backhaul constraints into weighted per-BS power constraints and solve the weighted sum rate maximization problem through a generalized weighted minimum mean square error approach. This paper shows that the proposed dynamic clustering algorithm can achieve significant performance gain over existing naive clustering schemes. This paper also proposes two heuristic static clustering schemes that can already achieve a substantial portion of the gain.",

The nanoparticles can be functionalized as molecular probes for biological targets to facilitate numerous preclinical studies for translation toward diagnosis and therapy of various human diseases. Iodine has a K-edge at 33 keV due to the photoelectric absorption of photons, which emit X-ray fluorescence at 28 keV with a fluorescence yield of 0.88. Detections of the characteristic X-rays can be used for the imaging of iodine concentration distribution in an object. In this paper, we propose an X-ray fluorescence computed tomography method for reconstruction of a LINPs distribution over a region of interest (ROI) in a small animal. X-rays are focused onto a submillimeter focal spot utilizing a polycapillary lens, generating a pair of X-ray cones in the animal. This focused beam irradiates LINPs, the most strongly at the focal spot. Then, the focal spot can be scanned over an ROI in the object to produce X-ray fluorescence signals. From measured fluorescence data, a reliable image reconstruction can be achieved with a high spatial resolution. Numerical simulation studies are performed to demonstrate the superior imaging performance of this methodology.",

Resource management has its taxonomy, which includes discovery of resources, selection of resources, allocation of resources, pricing of resources, disaster management, and monitoring of resources. Specifically, monitoring provides the means of knowing the status and availability of the physical resources and services within the cloud infrastructure. This results in making “monitoring of resources” one of the key aspects of the cloud resource management taxonomy. However, managing the resources in a secure and scalable manner is not easy, particularly when considering a federated cloud environment. A federated cloud is used and shared by many multi-cloud tenants and at various cloud software stack levels. As a result, there is a need to reconcile all the tenants’ diverse monitoring requirements. To cover all aspects relating to the monitoring of resources in a federated cloud environment, we present the FEDerated Architecture for Resource manaGement and mOnitoring in cloudS Version 1.0 (FEDARGOS-V1), a cloud resource monitoring architecture for federated cloud infrastructures. The architecture focuses mainly on the ability to access information while monitoring services for early identification of resource constraints within short time intervals in federated cloud platforms. The monitoring architecture was deployed in a real-time OpenStack-based FEDerated GENomic (FEDGEN) cloud testbed. We present experimental results in order to evaluate our design and compare it both qualitatively and quantitatively to a number of existing Cloud monitoring systems that are similar to ours. The architecture provided here can be deployed in private or public federated cloud infrastructures for faster and more scalable resource monitoring.",

        "abstract": "Cloud storage has been gaining tremendous popularity, which provides facilitative data storage and sharing services for distributed clients. To maximize the availability and reliability, some customers may store multiple replicas of critical data on cloud servers. However, cloud servers may collude to make it look like they are storing multiple copies of data, whereas in fact they only store a single copy. Currently, several multi-replica provable data possession schemes have been proposed to provide verifications to ensure that all the outsourced copies are actually stored and maintained intact. For these schemes with third-party verifications, correctly choosing public keys of data owners relies on the public key infrastructure (PKI), which is complicated and resource consuming. In this paper, we propose a novel identity-based public multireplica provable data possession scheme (IDPMR-PDP) to provide third-party verification of outsourced data with multiple replicas without PKI. We also introduce a formal security model of identity-based public multi-replica PDP schemes and prove that the IDPMR-PDP is secure against malicious cloud servers and privacy-preserving against curious verifiers under this model. Meanwhile, our analyses and simulation results demonstrate that the IDPMR-PDP realizes efficient integrity verification.",

An emerging research topic in data mining, known as privacy-preserving data mining (PPDM), has been extensively studied in recent years. The basic idea of PPDM is to modify the data in such a way so as to perform data mining algorithms effectively without compromising the security of sensitive information contained in the data. Current studies of PPDM mainly focus on how to reduce the privacy risk brought by data mining operations, while in fact, unwanted disclosure of sensitive information may also happen in the process of data collecting, data publishing, and information (i.e., the data mining results) delivering. In this paper, we view the privacy issues related to data mining from a wider perspective and investigate various approaches that can help to protect sensitive information. In particular, we identify four different types of users involved in data mining applications, namely, data provider, data collector, data miner, and decision maker. For each type of user, we discuss his privacy concerns and the methods that can be adopted to protect sensitive information. We briefly introduce the basics of related research topics, review state-of-the-art approaches, and present some preliminary thoughts on future research directions. Besides exploring the privacy-preserving approaches for each type of user, we also review the game theoretical approaches, which are proposed for analyzing the interactions among different users in a data mining scenario, each of whom has his own valuation on the sensitive information. By differentiating the responsibilities of different users with respect to security of sensitive information, we would like to provide some useful insights into the study of PPDM.",

The simulation of the instrument is introduced to a multi-objective optimizer to calculate its optimal set of geometrical and material features, considering the importance of the three key parameters. For a string musical instrument this approach is based on a hybrid model of Digital Signal Processing simulating the vibrating string and of Finite Elements Method simulating the effect of the body. The simulation technique has been validated by building an ancient guitar and comparing its recordings with its analogous digital model. The proposed method can be put into practice to investigate the building details of any instrument by introducing the relevant simulation and the objective’s function parameters. This work is expected to provide a powerful tool for the musical instrument makers towards a more efficient design of a bespoke instrument.",

This study concentrates on the analysis of the hyperspectral images of apples to distinguish and classify pure apples and those subjected to fertilizers in different concentration levels. This classification is fundamental to ensuring food quality and optimizing fertilizer input and precision agriculture practices. The dataset did not initially satisfy requirements owing to the small sample size, which rendered it difficult to train any robust generalizable model. A conditional GAN variation (CGAN) has been proposed for data augmentation. This approach effectively handled class imbalance by generating high-quality, category-specific synthetic images that enriched the dataset with realistic and diverse samples. For classification, the ConvNeXt architecture was employed, integrated with the Simple Attention Module (SimAM) to enhance feature refinement and extraction. The SimAM module allowed the model to focus on the most relevant areas of hyperspectral images while suppressing unimportant information, leading to a highly refined representation of features. The proposed classification model achieved an impressive accuracy of 99.75%, showcasing its exceptional ability to distinguish between different categories of apples, including untreated ones and those with varying fertilizer concentrations. This high level of accuracy underscores the model’s robustness and reliability in agricultural image analysis.",

        "title": "How Much Power Is Needed for RIS to Beat Relays? A Sustainability Framework",
        "abstract": "Future wireless networks are expected to utilise reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) to enhance coverage and communication quality. However, to ensure efficient RIS deployment and operation, it is crucial to understand the operational costs of RIS-assisted communication systems. This study aims to investigate the potential of RIS integration to improve the sustainability and energy efficiency of wireless communication networks, focusing on quantifying and minimising the operational cost of RIS-assisted communications. We present an in-depth analysis of power dissipation in RIS circuitry, emphasising both static and dynamic elements and offering a thorough breakdown of the operational costs associated with RIS-assisted communications. Our study examines control circuit components, control boards, and other factors contributing to dynamic power dissipation. We also develop a precise optimisation problem that addresses RIS power dissipation, aiming to minimise total power consumption in RIS-assisted communication systems while meeting essential communication constraints. In particular, we consider the rate requirements and the phase shift constraints, which enables our optimisation approach to be both theoretically valid and applicable to practical network scenarios. To address the optimisation problem effectively, we have developed a robust algorithm based on the particle swarm optimisation approach (PSO). This algorithm chooses the optimum number of RIS elements and adjusts the phase shifts matrix to reduce power dissipation while maintaining the channel gain required to achieve service requirements. Also, we present a comparison with active solutions in terms of power requirements, spectral efficiency, and environmental impact. Our analysis provides valuable insights into the advantages of RIS deployment, especially at higher data rates. It also highlights the importance of considering alternative relay techniques when tailoring wireless communication systems...",

        "abstract": "GeoSpatial (GS) data plays an important role for decision-making in different sectors such as engineering, economic, political, environmental, and social aspects. Internet of Spatial Things (IoST) is concerned with revising the Internet of Things (IoT) with the spatial perspective. Cloud environment is used to transmit, process, and analysis a huge amount of GS data. Fog computing is a paradigm, where embedded computers are employed to increase the throughput and reduce latency at the edge of the network. In this paper, an efficient GS Data framework for a Fog environment (GSDFog) is proposed to improve the performance of transmission, process, and analysis of a huge amount of GS data. It has three main contributions, A queuing model is used to balance the load over the available resources, this model considers two types of requests to optimally manage the query and storage operations. A novel GSDFog framework that uses the Pundc cloud instead of the traditional QGIS cloud is used for fog environment to process GS requests. Finally, GSDFog has been implemented and tested on a case study that uses tourism GS data in Port Said city to evaluate the performance of the proposed framework. The proposed GSDFog framework is compared against the traditional QGIS application in different scenarios. The proposed framework is implemented and tested on k6 open-source testing tool. The results show that the GSDFog framework outperforms the QGIS in terms of number of handled requests, average response time, and CPU utilization.",

        "abstract": "This study was to present a methodology for analyzing the distribution and spatial-time dependence of the supply of forest bioelectricity in Brazil, from 2000 to 2019. The data for the granting of forest biomass thermoelectric plants were obtained from the National Electric Energy Agency (in Portuguese Agência Nacional de Energia Elétrica –ANEEL). It used the exploratory analysis of spatial data, and as neighborhood criteria the spatial weighting matrices of k-neighbors closest and based on distance, as well as the global and local Moran indices to detect the presence of spatial dependence. The analysis of the situation, by quartile, showed the states of the central-southern portion of Brazil as the main locations of forest thermals.IMoran_Globalhighlighted the decrease in spatial autocorrelation between the years 2000 and 2019, associated with the implementation of new thermoelectric plants by the large groups Fibria, Klabin and Suzano Celulose throughout the national territory. The local index (IMoran_Local) pointed out high-powered clusters, especially in the early years, highlighting: the Bahia, Espírito Santo and Minas Gerais axis, the Paraná thermal plants and Mato Grosso do Sul thermal plants. The local index also pointed outliers, which indicated possibility of associating thermoelectric plants with other activities, such as wood production and industries in the steel and paper and cellulose segment. The knowledge of the spatial pattern of the forest bioelectricity sector presented can help new feasibility studies for the implementation in bioelectricity and/or stimulate the development of public policies, focused on cluster regions and adjacent areas, which results in the growth of forest generation.",

In this context, the need for Security by Design (SbD), integrating security into the earlier phases of software development lifecycle, is becoming more obvious, with threat modeling recognized as a fundamental element of SbD. In particular, as part of the Shift Left strategy—which focuses on saving costs and time by detecting and resolving security threats early—personnel with limited security expertise, such as software developers, are required to engage in threat modeling. Although various automated threat modeling tools have been released, their lack of usability for users with limited security expertise poses challenges in effectively conducting threat modeling. To address this, we analyzed the usability of threat modeling tools based on criteria derived from the GQM (Goal-Question-Metric) approach. An expert survey was conducted to derive the importance of each criterion and utilize it as a weighting factor. We performed usability evaluations of five threat modeling tools (MS TMT, OWASP TD, PyTM, IriusRisk, SPARTA), and concluded that IriusRisk is the most usable one among them. This study proposes criteria of usability for software to assist personnel with limited security expertise in effectively performing threat modeling, thereby fostering a supportive environment.",

Starting from the pixels belonging to a normalized gray-level image, an appropriate smooth S-shaped fuzzy membership function (MF) is considered for gray-scale transformation and is adaptively developed through noise reduction and information loss minimization. Then, a set of fuzzy patches is extracted from the MF, and for each support of each patch, we compute four ascending-order statistics that become points inside a 4-D fuzzy unit hypercube after a suitable fuzzification step. CE is performed by computing the distances among the above points and the points of maximum darkness and maximum brightness (special vertexes in the hypercube), and by determining the rotation of the tangent line to the MF around a crucial point where fuzzy patches and the MF coexist. The proposed procedure enables high CE in all the treated images with performance that is fully comparable with that obtained by three more sophisticated fuzzy techniques and by standard histogram equalization.",

        "abstract": "Human blockage at millimeter-wave frequencies is most commonly modeled through Knife-Edge Diffraction (KED) from the edges of the body shaped as a vertical strip. Although extensively validated in controlled laboratory experiments, the model does not scale to realistic 3D scenarios with many, randomly oriented bodies, on which multipath signals can be incident from any direction, not just normal to the strip. To address this, in this article we investigate computational electromagnetic methods based on raytracing. In addition to the KED method, we compare the Uniform Theory of Diffraction (UTD) and Physical Optics (PO) methods against an extensive suite of precision channel measurements at 60GHz. And in addition to the vertical strip, cylinder and hexagon body shapes are considered with the UTD method, and a 3D phantom shape is considered with the PO method. We found that the PO method is the most accurate, but also the most computationally intensive due to the large number of faces (approximately 8000) in the phantom and due to the inherent complexity of the method itself. While the UTD method with the hexagon shape (approximately 42 faces) is slightly less accurate than the PO method, it provides the best compromise when efficiency is paramount.",

The actual classification tasks are performed with a measurement chain including an in-house designed pressure mattress, a matrix of30×11sensing spots, a data concentrator, and a cloud-based service. Utilizing a survey of open-source datasets that facilitate such classifying operations, we designed a relevant experiment. A Human Lying Posture Pressure-Map dataset (HLPPDat) formed during the research is publicly available. Involving 20 subjects in 64 defined postures, the classification output was separated into four basic groups included prone posture. The data enabled us to analyze multiple classification methods developed with the state-of-the-art concepts of Machine Learning (ML), sparse representation, and artificial intelligence represented by Transfer Learning (TL). The analysis included both data measured and data experimentally corrupted in a manner that would most probably occur due to a partial measurement error. Regarding the techniques and options tested, feature extraction via the Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG) and the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) tools appeared to be the most beneficial, yielding an accuracy of over 99.5% in the leave-one-subject-out crossvalidation. The research confirmed that an accurate classification is feasible at a matrix sensor resolution markedly lower than the limits regularly presented in the literature. The system allows monitoring how long a bedridden person has remained in the same posture, and thus it has a potential to help prevent decubitus in both hospitals and the home care.",

Theoretical analysis revealed that the impedance and isolation bandwidth are directly related to the reflection coefficients of the even- (Γe) and odd-mode (Γo) bisected networks. Simultaneous broadening of the impedance and isolation bandwidth is possible through the optimum choice of design parameters which confines the trajectories of theΓeandΓoin the low constant-Q region on the Smith Chart.

When user data demands are uniform, satisfying the user requests is much easier than when demands are diverse. Yet, in a multicast scenario, each user may wish to view the same multicast data at different bit rates based on their own device capacities or resolutions. In this paper, we consider device-to-device (D2D) multicast users who may demand the multicast data at various rates, and in return, they offer different profits (revenue) to the telecom operator. Moreover, users may have different channel qualities from the base station, which will also affect the data rates. We show that satisfying the user requests to maximize the profit becomes NP-hard when the resource blocks are limited, and propose a greedy heuristic and two approximation algorithms to solve this problem. Besides, we consider an alternative objective of maximizing the number of satisfied users and propose a greedy heuristic algorithm for this variant. Our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms offer higher profit, throughput, and satisfy more users than the other candidate algorithms.",

The nature of social settings allows numerous people to co-exist in the same space. This close un-bounded proximity opens up the possibility of privacy compromise in such environments. In this paper, we explore a novel and practical multi-modal side-channel keystroke recognition system, named ClickLeak, which can infer the PIN code/password entered on numeric keypad by using the commodity Wi-Fi devices. Such numeric keypads are commonly available in many public social environments. ClickLeak is built on the observation that each key input makes unique pattern of hand and finger movements, and this generates unique distortions to multi-path Wi-Fi signals. Acceleration and microphone sensors of smart phones determine the starting and ending time of keystrokes, while the time series of channel state information are analyzed to determine the keystrokes. The evaluation results have shown that with large scale data collections from public social settings, the key recognition accuracy can reach higher than 83%.",

        "abstract": "This study investigated the prospect of embedding ceramic elements in the body of a double-core transverse-flux machine to mitigate heat in the machine’s coil. In addition, the ceramic elements were used to hold the coil above the permanent magnets in order to reduce the negative flux leakage of the magnets into the coil. Three types of ceramics were investigated for this purpose: glass ceramic, aluminum oxide, and silicon nitride. Steady-state thermal analysis demonstrated a significant temperature drop in the motor coil when the ceramic element was embedded in the design. The back electromotive force of the winding improved by 30% as a result of reduced leakage flux. Structural analysis of the motor demonstrated high endurance of the ceramic elements to thermal stress and motor vibration. The results of computer thermal analysis were verified in the laboratory by performing a test on a section of a motor.",

A digital pulsewidth modulated switching method was used to control the current pulse shape using an Arduino Uno microcontroller, which supplied signals to the gate of a MOSFET transistor that controlled the current to the system solenoid. An efficiency increase of 5.7% was obtained for a reluctance accelerator with an optimized current pulse shape in comparison to a capacitor discharge with no pulse shaping.",

With the fast development of the Internet of Things (IoT), new challenges regarding PAKE have emerged. The traditional PAKE protocols are completely insecure in IoT environments, since there are many kinds of side-channel attacks. Therefore, it is very important to model and design leakage-resilient (LR) PAKE protocols. However, there has been no prior work on modeling and constructing LR PAKE protocols. In this paper, we first formalize an LR eCK security model for PAKE based on the eCK-secure PAKE model and the only computation leakage model. Then, we propose the first LR PAKE protocol by using Diffie-Hellman key exchange, LR storage (LRS) and LR refreshing of LRS appropriately and formally present a security proof in the standard model.",

        "title": "Assessing Notification Timing Strategies for Improved Micro-Learning Engagement",
        "abstract": "Micro-learning has been widely adopted in recent years as an approach to improve online learning, particularly on mobile applications. Micro-learning is a method of dividing learning content into smaller lessons that can be completed within a short period (e.g., from ten to 15 minutes). While micro-learning is often seen as a way to boost user engagement, strategies to optimize engagement within these applications remain underexplored. This study aims to examine the impact of notification delay times to enhance user engagement in language learning activities within micro-learning platforms. Specifically, we developed a notification system designed to encourage users to transition from social media usage to educational activities: in this case, the Duolingo application. Over a three-week period, we conducted a within-subject experiment with 10 different users, with each week dedicated to one of three notification delay times - the period of time our proposed system waits before sending a notification once a social media usage activity is recognized: immediate (0 minutes), 15 minutes, and 30 minutes. Our findings reveal that notifications sent after a delay of 15 and 30 minutes - significantly increase both the response rate and the duration of learning sessions compared to immediate notifications. This suggests that a strategic delay in sending study reminders can substantially enhance engagement and prolong the duration of learning, offering valuable insights into designing educational technologies that foster sustained learning habits.",

        "abstract": "Machine type communications (MTCs) enable the communications of machines (devices) to machines over mobile networks. Besides simplifying our daily lives, the MTC business represents a promising market for mobile operators to increase their revenues. However, before a complete deployment of MTC over mobile networks, there is need to update the specifications of mobile networks in order to cope with the expected high number (massive deployment) of MTC devices. Indeed, large scale deployment of MTC devices represents an important challenge as a high number of MTC devices, simultaneously connecting to the mobile network, may cause congestion and system overload, which can degrade the network performance and even result in network node failures. Several activities have been led by 3GPP to alleviate system overload introduced by MTC. Most of the devised approaches represent only incremental solutions. Unlike these solutions, we devise a complete new architectural vision to support MTC in mobile networks. This vision relies on the marriage of mobile networks and cloud computing, specifically exploiting recent advances in network function virtualization (NFV). The aim of the proposed vision, namely LightEPC, is: 1) to orchestrate the on-demand creation of cloud-based lightweight mobile core networks dedicated for MTC and 2) to simplify the network attach procedure for MTC devices by creating only one NFV MTC function that groups all the usual procedures. By doing so, LightEPC is able to create and scale instances of NFV MTC functions on demand and in an elastic manner to cope with any sudden increase in traffic generated by MTC devices. To evaluate LightEPC, some preliminary analysis were conducted and the obtained analytical results indicate the ability of LightEPC in alleviating congestion and scaling up fast with massive numbers of MTC devices in mobile networks. Finally, a real-life implementation of LightEPC on top of cloud platform is discussed.",

        "abstract": "Grid-connected large-scale power converter-based intermittent renewable energy sources (RES) reduce system inertia, increase frequency fluctuation, and increase the rate of change of frequency (RoCoF). An energy storage system (ESS) is an indispensable component of a smart grid, and is used to overcome low-inertia problems. However, the capital and maintenance costs of ESS are high and high RoCoF events are less frequent in power systems. Therefore, the introduction of a virtual energy storage system (VESS) to provide the function of a conventional ESS for power system ancillary services is an innovative and cost-effective method. This study investigated a VESS using photovoltaic (PV) generators and inverter air conditioners (IACs) to provide virtual inertia and frequency regulation for a low-inertia microgrid. A model predictive control (MPC)-based VESS regulates indoor temperature, microgrid frequency, and RoCoF. The impact of parameter variation, that is, the microgrid frequency weight, indoor temperature weight, virtual inertia gain, and number of IACs, was studied and selected by considering the ability of the parameters to provide virtual inertia and frequency regulation. Finally, the efficiency and robustness of the proposed MPC-based VESS technique are compared with those of a conventional VESS. Simulation results revealed that the proposed MPC-based VESS can improve the virtual inertia, reduce the frequency deviation, and reduce the RoCoF of the studied microgrid. In addition, the proposed method is robust to variations in the system parameters.",

In this case, by constructing the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional and using some summation inequalities to estimate its forward difference, a new stochastic stability criterion of DTMJSs can be obtained, which has less conservatism than existing results. On the other hand, by utilizing the homogeneous polynomial approach, the novel delay-dependent stability condition of DTMJSs with uncertain transition probability is proposed.

The results and statistical analysis reveal that the proposed hybrid method outperforms the common algorithms used in the literature like genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), ant colony optimization (ACO), and firefly algorithm (FA).

It is useful in differential diagnosis and in understanding disease progression. However, determining the cough type in clinical practice can be subjective and sometimes unfeasible. This work, therefore, aims to develop an objective assessment method of the cough type. The proposed approach emulates the sound recognition process of humans. In particular, it uses the human auditory model to reveal the frequency characteristics of the cough sound signals and convolutional neural networks for decision-making. It is validated on a dataset of smartphone recordings of 396 cough samples from 88 subjects annotated as wet or dry by up to four expert pulmonologists. The cough signals are automatically segmented and time-frequency image data augmentation is performed during training using the synthetic minority oversampling technique to prevent model overfitting. A sensitivity of 93.13% and specificity of 91.42% (AUC= 0.9700) is achieved in segmentation of cough and non-cough sounds and a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 82.50% (AUC= 0.9234) is achieved in detecting subjects with wet and dry cough. The proposed fully automated system in detecting subjects with wet and dry cough demonstrates strong classification performance. It has the potential to provide objective assessment of cough type using smartphone technology, such as in virtual healthcare which has seen an increased uptake during the ongoing pandemic.",

        "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) is a collection of inexpensive, semi-autonomous, Internet-connected devices that sense and interact within the physical world. IoT security is of paramount concern because most IoT devices use weak or no encryption at all. This concern is exacerbated by the fact that the number of IoT deployments continues to grow, IoT devices are being integrated into key infrastructures, and their weak or lack of encryption is being exploited. Specific Emitter Identification (SEI) is being investigated as an effective, cost-saving IoT security approach because it is a passive technique that uses inherent, distinct features that are unintentionally imparted to the waveform during its formation and transmission by the IoT device’s Radio Frequency (RF) front-end. Despite the amount of research conducted, SEI still faces roadblocks that hinder its integration within operational networks. Our work focuses on the lack of feature permanence across time and environments, which is designated herein as the “multi-day” problem. We present results and analysis for six distinct experiments focused on improving multi-day SEI performance through multiple waveform representations, deeper Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), increasing numbers of waveforms, channel model impacts, and two-channel mitigation techniques. Our work shows improved multi-day SEI performance using the waveform’s frequency-domain representation and a CNN comprised of four convolutional layers. However, the traditional channel model and both channel mitigation techniques fail to sufficiently mitigate or remove real-world channel impacts, which suggests that the channel may not be the dominant effect hindering multi-day SEI performance.",

Wireless Inductive Power Transfer is chosen for its high isolation between primary and secondary windings, ensuring isolation from control to power circuits. Series-series reactive power compensation is applied due to the low coupling factor, which causes elevated circulation of reactive power and thus losses can be increased. The resonant circuit is powered by a controlled current source instead of a voltage source, ensuring appropriate voltage regulation without a voltage loop control and the need of control signal transmission between primary and secondary windings. A Proportional Resonant control scheme is implemented to apply a sinusoidal input current source, increasing the power factor and reducing reactive power. This paper presents the operation, modeling and control of proposed topology.

Conventional haze removal techniques can remove the light haze in the image by using various image processing algorithms or machine learning techniques. However, they may not provide a clear image under heavy scattering media. On the other hand, peplography can visualize the object by detecting ballistic object photons from heavy scattering media. Then, 3D image can be generated by integral imaging. However, it may not visualize 3D object information accurately because of the noise photons from scattering media. Therefore, the image quality for 3D object visualization may be degraded. To solve this problem, we use the discrete wavelet transform in peplography. It can detect the object photon signals from the scattering media and enhance 3D image contrast ratio by using a specific coefficient threshold technique. To prove our method, we carry out optical experiments and compare results with the conventional haze removal method and peplography by using various image quality metrics such as correlation, structural similarity, and peak signal-to-noise ratio.",

A prototype consisting of a high-stiffness lead zirconate titanate beam with a proof mass and a flexible brass beam with a tip mass as well as an auxiliary structure adjusting repulsive magnetic force was fabricated to evaluate the IFLP effects. Experimental results showed that the performance of the magnetically levitated PVEH was varied with different IFLPs. With declining of the IFLP, the peak power output at the first resonance frequency decreased monotonically from 1541 to 343.2 μW, meanwhile, the power output initially decreased from 2735.6 to 904.5 μW and then constantly increased from 904.5 to 2220.9 μW at the second resonance frequency. The frequency variation at the first and second resonance points was 1.5 and 4 Hz, respectively. It was found that the IFLP had a stronger impact on the performance when it was above the horizontal orientation than below the horizontal orientation. Moreover, the IFLP brought a more significant influence on the second resonance frequency than the first one.

For example, the 4G long term evolution (LTE) system takes advantage of multiport antennas [multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technology] and orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) to improve the detection probability of single bitstream by diversity in the spatial and frequency domains, respectively. The 4G system also supports transmission of two bitstreams by appropriate signal processing of the MIMO subchannels. The reverberation chamber emulates according to previous works rich isotropic multipath (RIMP) and has proven to be very useful for characterizing smart phones for LTE systems. The measured throughput can be accurately modeled by the simple digital threshold receiver, accounting accurately for both the MIMO and OFDM functions. The throughput is equivalent to the probability of detection (PoD) of the transmitted bitstream. The purpose of this paper is to introduce a systematic approach to include the statistical properties of the user and his or her terminal, when characterizing the performance. The user statistics will have a larger effect in environments with stronger line-of-sight (LOS), because the angle of arrival and the polarization of the LOS contribution vary due to the user’s orientation and practices. These variations are stochastic, and therefore, we introduce the term random-LOS to describe this. This paper elaborates on the characterization of an example antenna in both RIMP and random-LOS. The chosen antenna is a wideband microbase transceiver station (BTS) antenna. We show how to characterize the micro-BTS by the PoD of one and two bitstreams in both RIMP and random-LOS, by considering the user randomly located and oriented within the angular coverage sector.

In this paper, an approach for emotion recognition on German text corpora is presented, which addresses these challenges with domain-generalized and context-sensitive methodologies. To achieve domain generalization, neural machine translation and weak supervision techniques are combined with multi-view learning, in which various data sources from different domains are utilized to improve the generalizability and to overcome the problem of lack of data. Using the BERT model as the primary architecture to capture contextual information, an overall F1-score of 65.5% and an accuracy of 68.1% are achieved while maintaining well-balanced results on the metrics over all considered domains and emotions. To ensure the legitimacy and reliability of the findings, further comprehensive evaluations and comparisons are conducted.

        "abstract": "One of the principal issues of alternative combustion modes for diesel engines (such as HCCI, PCCI, and LTC) is caused by the imbalances in the distribution of air and EGR across the cylinders, which affects the combustion process and ultimately cause significant differences in the pressure trace and indicated torque for each cylinder. In principle, a cylinder-by-cylinder control approach could compensate for air, residuals, and temperature imbalance. However, in order to fully benefit from closed-loop combustion control, it is necessary to obtain feedback signals from each engine cylinder to reconstruct the pressure trace. Therefore, cylinder imbalance is an issue that can be detected in a laboratory environment, wherein each engine cylinder is instrumented with a dedicated pressure transducer. This paper describes the framework and preliminary results of a model-based estimation approach to predict the individual pressure traces in a multicylinder engine relying on a very restricted sensor set, namely, a crankshaft speed sensor, a single production-grade pressure sensor. The objective of the estimator is to reconstruct the complete pressure trace during an engine cycle with sufficient accuracy to allow for detection of cylinder to cylinder imbalances. Starting from a model of the engine crankshaft dynamics, an adaptive sliding mode observer is designed to estimate the cylinder pressure from the crankshaft speed fluctuation measurement. The results obtained by the estimator are compared with experimental data obtained on a four-cylinder diesel engine.",

We approximate the nonlinear uncertain and discontinuous function with an invertible one, and use variable structure control theory to suppress the error of the approximate inverse. We rewrite the finite time reaching law or the terminal reaching law into the form of inequalities and use these inequalities to design a control law that drives the system state to the sliding surface in finite time, and one that ensures the convergence of the system speed and position errors to a narrow, adjustable width band around zero. The stability of the control system is also analyzed and proven. We demonstrate how to ensure the sufficiency of the available control effort, by the proper design of control parameters. The method is then validated on a numerical model of a nonlinear system with nonlinear, uncertain and discontinuous input function.",

Deep learning models must be able to produce the same results under different conditions such as brightness, image rotation, etc. Deep learning models must have high level robustness to be reliable to address real world problems. Unreliable systems may be harmful for critical systems such as security, healthcare, and military. In this study, it is aimed to evaluate image rotation robustness of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformer-based deep learning models: MobileNetV2, Residual Network 18 (ResNet18), Visual Geometry Group 16 (VGG16), EfficientNetB1, Vision Transformer (ViT), Data-Efficient Image Transformers (DeiT), and Pooling-based Vision Transformer (PiT). Canadian Institute for Advanced Research 100 classes (CIFAR100), Canadian Institute for Advanced Research 10 classes (CIFAR10) and California Institute of Technology 256 classes (Caltech256) datasets were used to evaluate the performance of the models. All deep learning models were trained with original train datasets. Image embeddings of train, test datasets, and their rotated forms were extracted. A Support Vector Classifier (SVC) was trained with embeddings of original dataset and concatenation of original and rotated form of train dataset. Performances on original test dataset and their rotated forms were evaluated. 10, 50, and 90 degrees rotated form of the datasets were used for rotated test dataset. F1-score metrics were used compare model performances. In conclusion, Transformer-based classification algorithms are more robust to image rotation than the CNN-based models.",

        "abstract": "The CRISPR/Cas9 system is a creative and innovative gene editing biotechnology tool in genetic engineering. Although several achievements have been attained using the CRISPR/Cas9 system, it is still a challenge to avoid off-target effects and improve the editing efficacy. Previous efforts on evaluating the efficacy and designing the guide RNA mainly focused on DNA properties. However, some DNA features have not been characterized but can be reflected by protein properties, such as the disorder features and the sequence conservation. In this paper, we provided a computational framework to identify important features related to the efficacy of CRISPR/Cas9 focusing on the properties of the proteins encoded by the target DNA fragments. The feature selection method, maximal-relevance-minimal-redundancy, was adopted to analyze these features. And incremental feature selection together with support vector machine, were employed to extract optimal features, on which an optimal classifier can be constructed. As a result, 152 important features were extracted, with which an optimal classifier based on support vector machine was built. This classifier obtained the highest MCC value of 0.355. Finally, a series of detailed biological analyses were performed on the optimal features. From the results, we found that some key factors may differentially affect the binding activity of sgRNAs to their targets. Among them, the disorder status of the target protein sequences was found to be a major factor that is related to the efficacy of sgRNAs, suggesting the DNA features associated with the protein disorder status could also affect the CRISPR/Cas9 efficacy.",

        "abstract": "Field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) combine hardware reconfigurability with a high degree of parallelism. Consequently, FPGAs offer performance gains and power savings for many applications. A recent trend has been to leverage the hardware versatility of FPGAs with the software programmability of central processing units (CPUs) to improve the performance of processing-intensive workloads. A variety of heterogeneous FPGA-CPU embedded systems are thus available. However, the security of FPGA-CPU systems has not yet been thoroughly evaluated. In this work, we demonstrate the first attack on FPGA-CPU platforms which leverages undervolting caused by the FPGA to inject faults and exploit them against a software encryption algorithm. The aggressor FPGA affects a CPU sharing the same system-on-chip (SoC). We show that circuits in the FPGA fabric, controlled by an attacker, can create a significant supply voltage drop which, in turn, faults the software computation performed by the CPU or even causes a denial-of-service attack. Our results do not rely on any hardware modifications of the target platform. We present a characterization of the attack parameters and the effects observed. Then, we leverage the FPGA-induced undervolting to fault multiplications executing on the CPU. We also highlight how an attacker might benefit from the injected faults to compromise the system’s security by demonstrating differential fault analysis (DFA) against an advanced encryption standard (AES) implementation. Our work exposes a new electrical-level threat in tightly integrated modern FPGA-CPU SoCs, bringing to light a need for more research on countermeasures.",

Robustness is achieved by dividing the signal into overlapping segments, transmitting each segment fast enough so that the segments no longer overlap, receiving these segments and reconstructing the message by overlap-adding the segments. A key feature of this scheme is that an exact sample rate match is not required to recover the signal. This method is implemented in a custom wideband software defined radio, with good results in the presence of interference and multipath. This method, referred to as time compression overlap-add (TC-OLA), represents a new concept and design approach and an advance in fundamental technology of the air interface physical layer that may be relevant to 5G wireless technologies.",

        "abstract": "One of the main challenges of embedded system design lies in the natural heterogeneity of these systems. We can say that embedded systems are electronic systems designed and programmed to tackle a specific application. Each application has its requirements, although embedded systems often combine many domain-specific subsystems. Considering this context, the design of embedded systems can be extremely challenging, including system modeling, simulation, formal verification, and the synthesis to a correct implementation. To manage the complexity of such systems, the design should start at higher levels of abstraction, based on formal models, without considering the low-level characteristics of the underlying software or hardware. These high-level formal meta-models, named models of computation (MoC), define a set of rules that dictate how computation should be performed and how they should communicate with each other, along with other information such as the notion of time. In this paper, we present as the main contribution a set of rules and interfaces that enable the proper mixing of different MoC domains in a framework for complex embedded system design, thus allowing a heterogeneous system composition at a high abstraction level, including the synchronous reactive, synchronous dataflow, and scenario-aware dataflow MoCs. We model both part of an avionic system and a reconfigurable RISC-V processor using these MoCs and the proposed interfaces as a case study showing the applicability brought by our proposal.",

However, current models fail to take the characteristics of terminal antennas into account. There is no massive MIMO channel model available that can be used for the evaluation of the influence of different antenna characteristics at the terminal side. In this paper, we provide a simulation framework that fills this gap. We evaluate the framework with antennas integrated into Sony Xperia handsets operating at 3.7 GHz as this spectrum is identified for the 5G new radio standard by 3rd Generation Partnership Project. The simulation results are compared with the measured terminal performance when communicating with the Lund University's massive MIMO testbed under the same loading conditions. Expressions are derived for comparison of the gain obtained from different diversity schemes computed from measured far-field antenna patterns. We conclude that the simulation framework yields the results close to the measured ones and that the framework can be used for antenna evaluation for terminals in a practical precoded massive MIMO system.",

However, detecting sound events in noisy environments is a challenging task. This is due to the fact that in a real audio signal several sound sources co-exist. Moreover, the characteristics of polyphonic audios are different from isolated recordings. It is also necessary to consider the presence of noise (e.g. thermal and environmental). In this contribution, we present a sound anomaly detection system based on a fully convolutional network which exploits image spatial filtering and an Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling module. To cope with the lack of datasets specifically designed for sound event detection, a dataset for the specific application of noisy bus environments has been designed. The dataset has been obtained by mixing background audio files, recorded in a real environment, with anomalous events extracted from monophonic collections of labelled audios. The performances of the proposed system have been evaluated through segment-based metrics such as error rate, recall, and F1-Score. Moreover, robustness and precision have been evaluated through four different tests. The analysis of the results shows that the proposed sound event detector outperforms both state-of-the-art methods and general purpose deep learning-solutions.",

        "abstract": "As service robots increasingly penetrate households, researchers have identified the factors that influence users’ intention to adopt them. Although sociodemographic aspects such as age and gender have been widely studied, gaps remain in considering household composition, particularly between single- and multi-person households. This study addresses this gap through a case study conducted in South Korea that examines how the perceived usefulness of home service robots for various tasks—such as basic and complex household chores, personal care, leisure and companionship, and healthcare—affects the intention to adopt them. An online survey of 400 participants was analyzed using partial least-squares structural equation modeling. The results indicate that the perceived usefulness of robots in performing basic household chores (β=0.34, p-value <0.01) and leisure and companionship tasks (β=0.32, p-value <0.01) significantly affects intention to adopt across household types, whereas their perceived usefulness in handling complex household chores (β=−0.33, p-value <0.01) and healthcare tasks (β=0.24, p-value <0.05) varies depending on household composition. This study contributes to the literature by addressing an understudied area and emphasizing the unique needs of the home context. By using household type as a moderating variable, it provides a novel framework for understanding how consumer acceptance of home service robots is influenced by evolving household dynamics. These findings lay the groundwork for future research on the development and implementation of home service robots in the context of changing household compositions.",

Most importantly, users can truly use network services anytime, anywhere. With increasing demand, the use of bandwidth and frequency spectrum resources is beyond expectations. This paper found that the frequency spectrum and network information have considerable relevance; thus, spectrum utilization and channel flow interactions should be simultaneously considered. We considered that software defined radio (SDR) and software defined networks (SDNs) are the best solution. We propose a cross-layer architecture combining SDR and SDN characteristics.

It enhances the desired signal based on the noise conditions of the individual omnidirectional sensors deployed in a complex dynamic environment that is prone to steering errors. The investigation of this algorithm was carried out in an interference-dominant, noisy automobile environment characterized by diffuse noise conditions. An embedded system measurement of real-time signals was carried out using omnidirectional acoustic sensors mounted in a model convertible F-Type car driven at speed limits of 20 to 50 mph. The simulation results indicate an array gain enhancement of 2 dB higher than the conventional Frost beamformer and it requires less sensors and filter taps for real-time reconfigurable implementations. The experimental results reveal that the average array gain of the regulated-element beamformer is 2.9 dB higher than the conventional Frost beamformer response. The minimum floor array gain of the regulated-element beamformer is 5 dB, representing 70% noise reduction than the conventional adaptive beamformers.",

In the aerospace industry, the DO-178C—Software Considerations in Airborne Systems and Equipment Certification—serves as the primary certification standard used by agencies such as the FAA and EASA to review and approve software-based systems. Although DO-178C aims to ensure system safety while providing evidence for certification, it does not prescribe a specific software development process, allowing flexibility for traditional Waterfall, Agile, or hybrid methods with appropriate adaptations for the aerospace context. This study proposes Scrum4DO178C, an Agile process based on Scrum, to meet the demanding requirements of aerospace software, including safety, robustness, reliability, and integrity. Scrum4DO178C introduces novel process enhancements specifically tailored to meet these criticality needs, while aligning with the standard. Unlike previous proposals that lack detail, this research presents a comprehensive, validated process applied in a real-world industry project at the highest criticality level (Level A - Catastrophic), offering insights beyond theoretical scenarios. The findings demonstrated that the Scrum4DO178C process improves project performance, allows frequent and manageable requirement changes, reduces Verification & Validation (V&V) effort, and increases efficiency while maintaining full compliance with DO-178C. The study also identifies areas for further improvement and suggests exploring the process in additional case studies, both within the aerospace industry and other domains with similarly stringent safety-critical requirements.

        "abstract": "The exponential growth of mobile data in macronetworks has driven the evolution of communications systems toward spectrally efficient, energy efficient, and fast local area communications. It is a well-known fact that the best way to increase capacity in a unit area is to introduce smaller cells. Local area communications are currently mainly driven by the IEEE 802.11 WLAN family being cheap and energy efficient with a low number of users per access point. For the future high user density scenarios, following the 802.11 HEW study group, the 802.11ax project has been initiated to improve the WLAN system performance. The 3GPP LTE-advanced (LTE-A) also includes new methods for pico and femto cell’s interference management functionalities for small cell communications. The main problem with LTE-A is, however, that the physical layer numerology is still optimized for macrocells and not for local area communications. Furthermore, the overall complexity and the overheads of the control plane and reference symbols are too large for spectrally and energy efficient local area communications. In this paper, we provide first an overview of WLAN 802.11ac and LTE/LTE-A, discuss the pros and cons of both technology areas, and then derive a new flexible TDD-based radio interface parametrization for 5G local area communications combining the best practices of both WiFi and LTE-A technologies. We justify the system design based on local area propagation characteristics and expected traffic distributions and derive targets for future local area concepts. We concentrate on initial physical layer design and discuss how it maps to higher layer improvements. This paper shows that the new design can significantly reduce the latency of the system, and offer increased sleeping opportunities on both base station and user equipment sides leading to enhanced power savings.

        "abstract": "In the past decade, there has been unprecedented growth in distributed generation (DG) to cater to more load demand in the power grid. However, as the volume of these resources in the distribution network (DN) continues to increase, new challenges in voltage regulation, system stability, and protection coordination have emerged. The system is substantially changed when multiple types of DGs are incorporated into DN. These include new fault condition sources, different fault stages, a blinding influence on the protection scheme, a decrease in the relays’ range, and a decline in the ability of existent relays to detect low-level fault currents. Due to the bidirectional current flow, this raises the fault current and, if improperly coordinated, causes the relays to trip unintentionally. Since fault current can flow in either direction (i.e., upstream or downstream), it is crucial that grid-mounted relays can detect it. This goal can be reached by including an optimal directional overcurrent relay (DOCR) coordination scheme in the system. In fact, DOCRs in interconnected power grids need to be coordinated effectively. This paper gives a comprehensive overview of the uses of various optimization strategies. The evaluation examines the benefits and drawbacks of the strategies used to address DOCR coordination problems. Additionally, this paper discusses future lines of inquiry for optimum DOCR coordination.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a hierarchical path planning framework for efficient and practical robot navigation in environments with unknown obstacles that are not registered in a given map. While existing path planning approaches primarily focus on separately enhancing the performance of either the local or global planner, we propose a novel framework that employs a target planner to integrate the two, enabling adaptive navigation toward the final goal position via reachable waypoints. The proposed framework integrates a visibility-based target planner to dynamically evaluate the distance and heading visibility of the current target waypoint along a global path computed by the global planner. By dynamically assessing visibility, the visibility-based target planner autonomously updates the robot’s target waypoint if the current waypoint becomes unreachable owing to obstacles, thereby ensuring that the local planner efficiently navigates the robot to the updated target. Experiments were conducted to validate the proposed framework against a conventional sequential waypoint assignment approach. The results demonstrate that, compared to the conventional approach, the hierarchical framework using the visibility-based target planner reduces the overall navigation time by 49.6 % and 52.6 % in two different experiments while requiring fewer control commands. These improvements indicate that the proposed framework effectively minimized unnecessary detours and enabled the robot to reach the final goal position more efficiently, even in the presence of unmapped obstacles.",

Both emission-type tomographic imaging modalities use external X-rays to stimulate secondary emissions, either light or secondary X-rays, which are then acquired for tomographic reconstruction. These modalities surpass the limits of sensitivity in current X-ray imaging and have the potential of enabling X-ray imaging to extract molecular imaging information. These new modalities also promise to break through the spatial resolution limits of other in vivo molecular imaging modalities. This paper reviews the development of X-ray luminescence and X-ray fluorescence CT and their relative merits. The discussion includes current problems and future research directions and the role of these modalities in future molecular imaging applications.",

The characteristic equations for various control loops in WES have been developed, and the most stable zones have been identified in the parametric plane by means of the D-partition technique and frequency scanning check. To ensure high degree of relative system stability and good damping ratio, the PI controller parameters have been selected by comparing the step responses of the control loop plotted for different sets of controller parameters chosen from the identified stable zone.

        "abstract": "Hybrid Message Passing Interface (MPI) and Open Multi-Processing (OpenMP) parallel programs are pivotal for scalability and efficiency in high-performance computing (HPC), especially as systems approach exa-scale operations. These programs leverage distributed and shared memory systems, making them indispensable for scientific simulations, data analysis, and numerical computations. However, synchronization defects such as deadlocks and race conditions pose significant challenges to reliability and performance, often eluding traditional static and dynamic analysis tools due to the complexity of hybrid systems. This study introduces a deep learning-based models for automated defect prediction in hybrid MPI and OpenMP programs. Using a balanced dataset of 1,500 C++ files, three neural architectures—Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and a hybrid CNN-LSTM model—were evaluated. To preprocess the code, Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)-based token extraction was employed, capturing structural and semantic relationships critical for detecting defects. Token extraction methods included detailed C++ syntax analysis via the Clang library and a custom regular expression approach. The results reveal that Clang-token-based representation provided the most effective input for defect prediction, enabling CNN models to achieve an accuracy of 97%. By integrating AST-based structural insights with the predictive power of deep learning, this research offers a scalable solution for enhancing the reliability of hybrid parallel programs. The findings establish a foundation for future advancements in automated defect detection, addressing the pressing needs of high-performance computing systems.",

Moreover, by converting the conventional model of a TSV pair into an RC parallel circuit, a simplified model is established which makes the analysis of the silicon substrate concise associated with the frequency variation. To further reveal the influence of silicon substrate on the signal transmission between adjacent TSVs, relevant impedance parameters of the silicon substrate are converted into the impedance (Z) matrix for parametric modeling, which is validated by 3D full-wave simulations. This work contributes a systematic examination of the silicon substrate characteristics with the variation of frequency, and provides significant guidance for parametric analysis and modeling in TSV-based 3-D ICs.",

Coordination among transmitters and receivers to mitigate and/or exploit interference is hence seen as a main path toward 5G mobile networks. We provide an overview of existing coordinated beamforming strategies for interference mitigation in broadcast and interference channels. To gain insight into their ergodic behavior in terms of signal to interference and noise ratio as well as achievable transmission rate, we focus on a simplified but representative scenario with two transmitters that serve two users.

        "abstract": "Missing data is a common challenge in real-world datasets and can arise for various reasons. This has led to the classification of missing data mechanisms as missing completely at random, missing at random, or missing not at random. Currently, the literature offers various algorithms for imputing missing data, each with advantages tailored to specific mechanisms and levels of missingness. This paper introduces a novel approach to missing data imputation using the well-established label propagation algorithm, named Label Propagation for Missing Data Imputation (LPMD). The method combines, weighs, and propagates known feature values to impute missing data. Experiments on benchmark datasets highlight its effectiveness across various missing data scenarios, demonstrating more stable results compared to baseline methods under different missingness mechanisms and levels. The algorithms were evaluated based on processing time, imputation quality (measured by mean absolute error), and impact on classification performance. A variant of the algorithm (LPMD2) generally achieved the fastest processing time compared to other five imputation algorithms from the literature, with speed-ups ranging from 0.7 to 23 times. The results of LPMD were also stable regarding the mean absolute error of the imputed values compared to their original counterparts, for different missing data mechanisms and rates of missing values. In real applications, missingness can behave according to different and unknown mechanisms, so an imputation algorithm that behaves stably for different mechanisms is advantageous. The results regarding ML models produced using the imputed datasets were also comparable to the baselines.",

In the proposed scheme, the transmit antennas are divided into several equal-sized groups, and each group conducts spatial modulation (SM) independently. Two grouping methods, i.e., block grouping and interleaved grouping are proposed. In block grouping, the adjacent antennas are gathered in the same group. While in interleaved grouping, the average distance between the antennas in the same group is maximized in order to minimize the impact of channel correlation. In consideration of the practical massive MIMO systems, we conduct the proposed scheme both in a linear antenna array and a 2-dimensional antenna array. To evaluate the performance, we derive a closed-form average bit error probability (ABEP) upper bound for the proposed scheme. According to the ABEP upper bound, we derive the coding gain and diversity order of the proposed scheme to gain insight into the system performance. Numerical results show the performance gain achieved by the proposed scheme compared with the conventional GSM in terms of bit error rate.",

Multiple applications with various service-level-agreement (SLA) requirements can be provided utilizing the same network infrastructure to enable cost-effective underwater (UW) network deployment and maintenance, allowing for globally efficient resource management. Because various stakeholders may have different service level agreements (SLAs), underwater acoustic communication systems (UACS) must provide functional isolation of services. As a result, network slicing is critical in such networks. In this paper, a novel optimization framework for automated network slicing (ANS) in UACS is presented, which enables SLA-based admission control, routing, and dynamic resource allocation. It achieves optimized solutions and improves network performance, decreases deployment costs and simplifies network operation This paradigm is also in line with the development of 5G/6G networks. The proposed automatic slicing framework considers the difficult underwater acoustic channel characteristics to deliver a heuristic sub-optimal routing and resource allocation solution based on the SLA provided/required by network tenants/applications. An in-depth numerical analysis is used to test the suggested solution and compare it to state-of-the-art software-defined networks (SDN) routing and resource allocation algorithms.",

The residual tobacco contains fine particles that exhibit random distribution and varying edge morphologies. These factors contribute to the reduced accuracy and robustness of visual detection technologies based on segmentation algorithms within tobacco intelligent production systems, highlighting the need for a targeted segmentation model. In this study, we propose an enhanced lightweight segmentation model, GhostNetV3-Unet, designed explicitly for residual tobacco segmentation. Our approach utilizes an improved GhostNetV3 to bolster feature extraction capabilities. Additionally, we optimize the residual modules and activation functions to enhance the extraction of detailed features and the deep transmission of information. Furthermore, we enhance the semantic representation of fine residue features amidst complex backgrounds by incorporating a hybrid self-attention mechanism that integrates spatial information and channels attention within the decoding phase. We employ Focal Loss combined with Intersection over Union (IoU) loss to address the class imbalance challenge between positive and negative pixel classes, thereby improving the segmentation performance in regions with morphological and size variations. Moreover, we designed an image enhancement method based on Poisson fusion to mitigate the difficulties associated with sample labeling. This method employs a combination of randomly cropped, combined sample images and Poisson-fused background images to enhance edge contour clarity while effectively expanding the tobacco dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that the constructed artificial data samples can effectively substitute the original data samples, significantly reducing the labeling costs associated with sample preparation. On the tobacco dataset, the interaction rate of the proposed GhostNetV3-Unet model reaches 94.63%, with a checking rate o...",

        "abstract": "The massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system has drawn increasing attention recently as it is expected to boost the system throughput and result in lower costs. Previous studies mainly focus on time division duplexing (TDD) systems, which are more amenable to practical implementations due to channel reciprocity. However, there are many frequency division duplexing (FDD) systems deployed worldwide. Consequently, it is of great importance to investigate the design and performance of FDD massive MIMO systems. To reduce the overhead of channel estimation in FDD systems, a two-stage precoding scheme was recently proposed to decompose the precoding procedure into intergroup precoding and intragroup precoding. The problem of user grouping and scheduling thus arises. In this paper, we first propose three novel similarity measures for user grouping based on weighted likelihood, subspace projection, and Fubini-Study, respectively, as well as two novel clustering methods, including hierarchical and K-medoids clustering. We then propose a dynamic user scheduling scheme to further enhance the system throughput once the user groups are formed. The load balancing problem is considered when few users are active and solved with an effective algorithm. The efficacy of the proposed schemes are validated with theoretical analysis and simulations.",

It is also noted that not all products in a store are displayed on the shelf, especially the seasonal ones. This paper, therefore, addresses these issues by presenting an effective framework called temporal-based fuzzy utility mining to give more attention to the transaction period of given items according to the concept of fuzzy utility mining. The temporal-based fuzzy utility mining proposed here is, however, a more complex approach when compared with the traditional fuzzy utility mining. A more complicated model for non-lost upper-bound fuzzy utility is thus proposed for effective mining. Furthermore, based on this model, a two-phase algorithm is developed for temporal-based fuzzy utility mining.

In theoretical analysis, various types of noise such as Phase-Induced Intensity Noise (PIIN), shot noise, thermal noise, and Multiple-Access Interference (MAI) effects were considered. System performance was characterized by the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and bit error rate (BER). The analysis results obtained using the Spectral direct detection (SDD) technique were compared with those obtained using the AND subtraction and Modified AND subtraction detection techniques. The comparison results revealed that the FDW code with the SDD technique can support more active users and can improve system performance compared with the AND subtraction and Modified AND subtraction detection techniques. The FDW code is compared to the previous OCDMA code, known as Enhanced Double Weight (EDW) code, in terms of the number of simultaneous users it can support. The FDW code can accommodate up to 52 simultaneous users which is a significant improvement over the EDW code’s capacity of 30 users. This represents a 73.33% improvement achieved through the use of SDD techniques. In simulation analysis, the results were exemplified by the simulation experiment of the BER performance in the system with the new FDW code. The BERs of the AND subtraction and Modified AND subtraction detection techniques were1.63×10−05and1.69×10−08, respectively, at a distance of 60 km, whereas the SDD technique’s BER was2.29548×10−12, which could reach up to 60 km with bit rate of 10 Gbps.",

        "abstract": "Microservice-based applications are increasingly being adopted along with cloud service models, and nowadays serve millions of customers daily. They are supported by container-based architectures which are managed by orchestration platforms, such as Kubernetes, that monitor, manage, and automate most of the tasks. Although these tools provide failover capabilities, it is not yet studied how effective they are in dealing with diverse types of faults. Fault injection is an effective methodology for validating components that are supposed to detect the malfunctions and report/correct them. This paper studies the effectiveness of Kubernetes in dealing with faults and aging in microservices, and on the possibility of using faults to accelerate aging effects for testing purposes. For this, we conducted an analysis of the implementation and tuning of Kubernetes probes, followed by experiments with varying load and fault injection into two distinct and representative microservice testbeds to analyze the capacity of probes in detecting issues in applications. The goal is to improve the knowledge of researchers and developers on whether Kubernetes can detect different faults and aging issues. Also, even though some services tend to accumulate aging effects, with increasing resource consumption, Kubernetes does not detect them nor acts on them, indicating that probes may be insufficient for aging scenarios. Results also showed that fault injection is useful to accelerate aging effects for the testing and evaluation purposes.",

        "abstract": "In wireless communication, compressed vision information may suffer from kinds of degradation, which dramatically influences the final visual quality. In this paper, a compressed vision information restoration method is proposed based on two explored vision priors: 1) the cloud prior and 2) the local prior. The cloud prior can be obtained from the nature images set in the cloud, and fields of experts is used to formulate the statistical character of the nature image contents as a high order Markov random field. The local prior is achieved from the degraded image itself, and K-SVD is adopted to model the sparse and redundant representation characters of nature images. These priors are effectively comprised in the proposed vision information restoration method. The relation between the quantization parameter and the optimal configuration of the prior models is further analyzed. In addition, an enhanced quantization constrained projection algorithm is proposed to refine the high frequency components. We extend this paper to compressed video restoration for H.264/AVC and the experiment results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can reproduce higher quality images compared with conventional H.264/AVC.",

Solar photovoltaic panels offer a promising alternative; however, their energy output fluctuations present challenges in maintaining a reliable power source. Accurate estimation of solar energy generation is critical for enhancing the competitiveness of solar power plants and fostering social and economic progress. This paper aims to develop a machine learning model that utilizes meteorological and time-related data to predict solar photovoltaic power generation. It investigates how various factors, such as humidity and seasonal variations, impact prediction accuracy. Three different ML models were used and compared: Support vector regression, XGBoost, and HistGradient Boost. To improve the performance of these models hyperparameter tuning techniques is used. The findings reveal that radiation, humidity levels, and seasonal variations are the most influential factors in predicting photovoltaic solar power generation. Additionally, incorporating seasonal and humidity data can enhance the machine-learning model’s accuracy by 17.9%. XGBoost model outperforms existing methods, achieving the highest accuracy of 95.76% when incorporating humidity and seasonal factors. Its lowest MAPE of 4.23 and highestR2of 99.1. to assess model precision, an uncertainty analysis was performed using p-factor and q-factors.

        "abstract": "Mobile Adhoc Network (MANET) is a wireless network in which data is transferred in a forwarding direction from the source node to the destination node via multiple intermediate nodes. Packets collision is considered one of the most crucial limitations in MANETs because the nodes in the network move in random directions at a random velocity which increases the probability of collision and this will harm the throughput, the routing overhead, and the end-to-end delay. Also, frequent node mobility leads to a topological change and link instability and this reduces the data delivery rate. Because of limited available paths to the destination node or having a high traffic load, the possibility of traffic congestion augments at the intermediate nodes which in turn affects the packet delivery, particularly with real-time applications in MANETs. In this paper, we propose an adaptive routing protocol based on a bio-inspired genetic algorithm (GA). We optimize the multiple paths returned by the AOMDV mechanism (AOMDV-FG) to select the best path to the destination. The route with the highest fitness value is considered the most optimum route. Lastly, we compare our proposed protocol with AOMDV-TA and EHO-AOMDV. We have used routing overhead, end-to-end delay, throughput, energy consumption, and packet delivery ratio as key metrics for the performance evaluation of our proposed model.",

        "abstract": "The network architecture of the public security video private network is relatively complex, and the types of devices it carries are different from those of general information networks. It mainly consists of video surveillance IoT devices, as well as numerous streaming media servers, video scheduling servers, structured computing power, big data computing power, storage devices, and network devices. These devices have strong regional dispersion. In such a network environment, when conducting alarm analysis and assessment for network intrusions, malicious code, and abnormal logs, the collected security logs have strong characteristics of multi-source and heterogeneity. Traditional log processing methods are prone to alarm fatigue, high false positive rates, and poor adaptability to complex traffic. To improve the accuracy and efficiency of alarm analysis and assessment, this paper proposes a model that integrates expert experience and supervised learning, called FEESLM, aiming to enhance the ability to judge network security alarms. The FEESLM model consists of three major components: the expert experience modeling component, the supervised learning modeling component, and the assessment result decision component. The expert experience modeling component summarizes the expert’s assessment experience to form rules, statistics, and association models. The supervised learning modeling component uses the XGBoost algorithm to learn from the data processed by expert experience, constructing a assessment model. The assessment result decision component uses the maximum entropy model to calculate the most credible results from the outputs of expert and supervised learning modeling as the final assessment result. Experimental results show that the FEESLM model outperforms single expert experience modeling and supervised learning modeling in terms of accuracy, recall rate, and F1-score, effectively improving the accuracy of network security alarm assessment.",

The CNT tube allows for flexible placement and distribution of X-ray focal spots in a system. Using a CNT tube, a computed tomography (CT) system with a noncircular geometry and a nonrotating gantry can be created. The noncircular CT geometry can be optimized around a specific imaging problem, utilizing the flexibility of CNT multibeam X-ray tubes to achieve the optimal focal spot distribution for the design constraints of the problem. Iterative reconstruction algorithms provide flexible CT reconstruction to accommodate the noncircular geometry. Compressed sensing-based iterative reconstruction algorithms apply a sparsity constraint to the reconstructed images that can partially account for missing angular coverage due to the noncircular geometry. In this paper, we present a laboratory prototype CT system that uses CNT multibeam X-ray tubes; a rectangular, nonrotating imaging geometry; and an accelerated compressed sensing-based iterative reconstruction algorithm. We apply a total variation minimization as our sparsity constraint. We present the advanced CNT multibeam tubes and show the stability and flexibility of these new tubes. We also present the unique imaging geometry and discuss the design constraints that influenced the specific system design. The reconstruction method is presented along with an overview of the acceleration of the algorithm to near real-time reconstruction. We demonstrate that the prototype reconstructed images have image quality comparable with a conventional CT system.

In this study, a systematic framework is proposed for the detailed sub-task analysis of human failure events (HFEs) involving portable equipment through utilization of STAMP (Systems-Theoretic Accident Model and Processes) and STPA (Systems-Theoretic Process Analysis). A case study was performed for a typical multi-unit emergency response involving a portable diesel generator. Through the proposed framework, detailed sub-tasks were identified for the HFE (“Failure of deploying the portable diesel generator”) in a form of unsafe control actions through a systemic approach. The results showed that the potential hazards that may not currently be analyzed in the traditional HRA enough include failed convocation of offsite workers, interorganizational communication between important EROs, and multi-unit decision making error on installing PDGs if there are conflict due to limited number of PDGs available. Results of the detailed HFE analysis using the proposed framework may be used as a basis to allow more realistic application of the HRA involving deployment of portable equipment (e.g., multi-unit accidents and beyond design-basis external events) that are better representative of the interorganizational characteristics.",

To address this challenge, FD-YOLO11, which is a YOLO11-based deep learning model with enhanced feature extraction and fusion mechanisms for attaining improved detection performance, is proposed in this paper. To enhance the multiscale feature extraction process, self-calibrated convolution is integrated into the C3k2 module. Additionally, an FSPPF structure is designed to optimize the process of fusing local and global information, improving the defect recognition ability of the model in complex backgrounds. Furthermore, the DySample mechanism replaces the traditional upsampling method, effectively refining the feature fusion process and minimizing the semantic information loss. The NEU-DET and GC10-DET datasets are used for evaluation purposes, and the experimental results demonstrate that FD-YOLO11 achieves 4.6% and 4.0% mAP@0.5 improvements over YOLO11s while maintaining an inference speed comparable to that of YOLO11s. This ensures a compromise between detection performance and computational efficiency. The model exhibits enhanced recognition capabilities and greater robustness in complex defect detection tasks.

Behavior patterns estimated from the trajectories of animals provide substantial useful information related to estrus cycle, disease prognosis and so on. However, similar colors and shapes between animals often lead to the failure of tracking multiple objects, and the background clutter of the breeding space further makes the problem intractable. In this paper, we propose a novel method for tracking animals using a single thermal sensor. The key idea of the proposed method is to represent the foreground (i.e., animals) easily obtained by a simple thresholding in a thermal frame as a topographic surface, which is very helpful for finding the boundary of each object even in cases with overlapping. Based on the segmentation results derived from morphological operations on the topographic surface, the center positions of all the animals are consistently updated with an efficient refinement scheme that is robust to the abrupt motions of animals. Experimental results using various thermal video sequences demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of our method for tracking animals in a breeding space compared to previous approaches proposed in the literature.",

Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed circuit achieves pulse-width modulation (PWM) down to a submicrosecond level, approximately0.6μs, with a falling time of0.05μs. This nearly ideal PWM operation enables the accurate expression of the lowest gray level down to 3 G. The proposed circuit also exhibited enhanced current uniformity and reduced inverter power consumption in low-gray levels. The average current error rate was less than 0.5% at 3 G, and the average inverter power in the mid- to low-gray levels was significantly reduced. This operational advancement was attributed to the adoption of a DSG scheme in the pixel circuit.",

Determining the best time to buy or sell stocks in a stock market, and thereby maximizing profit with low risks, is an important issue in financial research. Recent studies have used trading rules based on technique analysis to address this problem. This method can determine trading times by analyzing the value of technical indicators. In other words, we can make trading rules by finding the trading value of technique indicators. An example of a trading rule would be, if one technical indicator’s value achieves the setting value, then either buy or sell. A combination of trading rules would become a trading strategy. The process of making trading strategies can be formulated as a combinational optimization problem. In this paper, we propose a novel method for applying a trading system. First, the proposed method uses the quantum-inspired Tabu search algorithm to find the optimal composition and combination of trading strategies. Second, this method uses a sliding window to avoid the major problem of over-fitting. The experiment results of earning money show much better performance than other approaches, and the proposed method outperforms the buy and hold method (which is a benchmark in this field).",

        "abstract": "Power system inertia typically refers to the energy stored in large rotating synchronous generators. Dynamics and stability of the traditional power system is closely linked to the natural inertia of these synchronous generators. In recent years, increasing amount of synchronous generators have been replaced by high amount of different type of inverter-based generating units connected at different voltage levels of the power system. Therefore, the dynamics and stability of future low-inertia power systems will be increasingly dominated by the control and synchronization of these inverter-based resources. One essential issue is that the typical grid-following control with phase-locked-loop (PLL) -based synchronization of inverter-based generation is not enough to guarantee frequency stability in future low-inertia power systems. Therefore, different grid-forming inverter control and synchronization methods have been proposed and developed. Currently there does not exist any universal grid-forming control and synchronization method. Therefore, this paper tries to propose a new universal frequency-locked-loop (U-FLL) -based synchronization method which is grid-forming for inverter-based generating units and grid-supporting for inverter-based loads. Advantageous operation of the new U-FLL synchronization and control strategy is confirmed by multiple simulations with different shares of inverter-based resources and synchronous generators in MV and HV hybrid power systems as well as with 100 % inverter-based LV, MV and HV networks.",

        "title": "The Effect of Power Adjustment on Handover in High-Speed Railway Communication Networks",
        "abstract": "In future 5G communication systems, supporting high-quality wireless communications in high-mobility scenarios becomes very essential. Although many existing works indicate that increasing transmit power is able to reduce the handover failure probability (referred to as the power greedy scheme) through improving the radio condition or received signal strength, it goes against the requirement of green system design. In this paper, we investigate the effect of power adjustment on handover performance from the perspective of reducing the “uncertainty” in handover procedure in high-speed railway communications systems by embedding it into the existing handover procedure. It is shown that, with power adjustment, the handover performance can be improved without increasing extra energy consumption. The power adjustment-assisted handover scheme is applied to a high-speed railway scenario with distributed antenna system (DAS) cells. Both the blanket transmission-based handover scheme and the remote antenna unit selection transmission-based handover scheme are discussed for DAS cells. To evaluate the performance, the handover probability, handover failure probability, and communication interruption probability associated with two handover schemes are analyzed. Moreover, two new performance metrics, named handover occurrence probability and handover failure occurrence probability, are defined to efficiently evaluate the handover performance versus the position of the train. Both the analytical and the numerical results show that introducing power adjustment into handover gives ability to achieve a better performance compared with the current existing ones. Moreover, the power adjustment-assisted handover scheme is capable of achieving the similar system performance to existing power greedy scheme but without increasing energy consumption.",

The MDC is structured with strategic function-based layers of swarm deployment, coverage, and withdrawal built on top of the underlying behavior-based motion control layer. The behavior-based motion control layer is responsible for preserving the network integrity and guaranteeing collision avoidance for mobile robots. To enable adaptability and flexibility of control strategies in various unknown structured environments, the behavior suppression mechanism is created to modulate and substitute individual behaviors for appropriate swarm strategies including swarm movement in aggregation, one-chain configuration, collective coverage with target-tracking motions. We have examined and evaluated our proposed method through both simulation and real-world experiments. The results demonstrate that the MDC achieves high performance in both task completion and coverage rate while maintaining flexibility and scalability, highlighting its potential for real-world applications.",

To achieve this flexibility, it may be worth examining an unconventional algorithm such as topological methods. Here, we propose a fully parallelized algorithm for a shape-invariant touch counter for 2-D pixels. The number of touches is counted by the Euler integral, a generalized integral, in which a connected component counter (Betti number) for the binary image was used as elemental module. Through examples of touches, we demonstrate transparently how the proposed circuit architecture embodies the Euler integral in the form of recurrent neural networks for iterative vector operations.

In an effort, to preserve natural biodiversity and improve waste management, this research aims to substitute available raw materials for wood fibres. Empty fruit bunch (EFB) is regarded as waste in the oil palm industry and is abundantly available as a renewable energy source, particularly in Southeast Asian countries. The primary objective of this study is to investigate the utilisation of EFB as a substitute for insulating paper in transformers. The morphology, degree of polymerization, tensile strength, thermal characteristics, permittivity, conductivity, and electrical properties (breakdown field strength and lightning impulse performance) of EFB were measured and compared to the properties of Kraft insulating paper. Using FESEM at a magnification of500×, the morphological properties were examined. Based on FTIR measurement, the chemical bonding between Kraft and EFB samples varied slightly. Compared to EFB, Kraft-pulped insulating paper has a higher degree of polymerization and the ability to endure high temperatures. Furthermore, the breakdown field strength performance demonstrates that Kraft insulating paper is 20.30% higher than EFB insulating paper. In terms of tensile strength and lightning impulse, EFB insulating paper demonstrated comparable performance to conventional insulating paper. A new approach to the manufacturing of EFB insulating paper could result in improvements to the material’s insulation qualities.",

        "abstract": "Over the decades, the immense growth has been reported in research publications due to continuous developments in science. To date, various approaches have been proposed that find similarity between research papers by applying different similarity measures collectively or individually based on the content of research papers. However, the contemporary schemes are not conceptualized enough to find related research papers in a coherent manner. This paper is aimed at finding related research papers by proposing a comprehensive and conceptualized model via building ontology named COReS: Content-based Ontology for Research Paper Similarity. The ontology is built by finding the explicit relationships (i.e., super-type sub-type, disjointedness, and overlapping) between state-of-the-art similarity techniques. This paper presents the applications of the COReS model in the form of a case study followed by an experiment. The case study uses InText citation-based and vector space-based similarity measures and relationships between these measures as defined in COReS. The experiment focuses on the computation of comprehensive similarity and other content-based similarity measures and rankings of research papers according to these measures. The obtained Spearman correlation coefficient results between ranks of research papers for different similarity measures and user study-based measure, justify the application of COReS for the computation of document similarity. The COReS is in the process of evaluation for ontological errors. In the future, COReS will be enriched to provide more knowledge to improve the process of comprehensive research paper similarity computation.",

To address this, we propose OMS-DNN, a fully data-driven deep learning framework that replaces resource-intensive finite element analysis and ray tracing, while integrating optimization algorithms for forward design. OMS-DNN models complex nonlinear relationships using deep neural networks and captures parameter topologies through a graph convolutional network (GCN). We evaluate OMS-DNN on large-scale datasets, including 20,000 structural and 100,000 Three-Mirror Anastigmat (TMA) optical design samples. It achieves mean absolute percentage errors (MAPE) of 0.98%, 4.09%, and 1.66% across three key metrics. To meet forward design requirements, we integrated the proposed architecture with an optimization algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can rapidly generate constraint-compliant parameter design solutions tailored to various needs, thereby lowering the entry barrier for designers. These findings validate the effectiveness of OMS-DNN and its potential to transform traditional design workflows.",

        "abstract": "Nowadays, remote sensing image analysis is needed in various important tasks such as city planning, land-use classification, agriculture monitoring, military surveillance, and many other applications. In this context, hyperspectral images can play a useful role, but require specific handling. This paper presents a convolutional neural network based on one-dimensional support vector machine (SVM) convolution operations (1D-CSVM) for the analysis of hyperspectral images. SVM-based CNN (CSVM) was introduced first for the classification of high spatial resolution RGB images. It relies on linear SVMs to create filter banks in the convolution layers. In this work, the network is modified to cope with one-dimensional hyperspectral signatures and perform pixel-based classification. It thus analyzes each pixel spectrum independently from the pixel spatial neighborhood. Experiments were carried out on four benchmark hyperspectral datasets, Salinas-A, Kennedy Space Center (KSC), Indian Pines (IP) and Pavia University (Pavia-U). Compared to state-of-the-art models, the proposed network produces promising results for all tested datasets, with an accuracy up to 99.76%.",

In this context, this study has adopted a detailed approach to the emotion recognition problem on both speech and text data using the Interactive Emotional Dyadic Motion Capture (IEMOCAP) dataset. First, the problem of datasets with limited number of records and unbalanced distribution across classes was addressed. For this purpose, a dataset obtained from records created as improvised in the IEMOCAP dataset was used and data augmentation methods were applied for both speech and text data. Using datasets that were balanced by applying data augmentation, single-mode emotion recognition experiments were performed with models developed for Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) and Textual Emotion Recognition (TER). Subsequently, the features obtained from these two single modalities were combined with the intermediate fusion method to provide more comprehensive emotion recognition and accuracy, and the Bimodal Emotion Recognition (BiMER) system was developed. The ResNet50-CRNN+AT model, which we obtained the highest accuracy from the three different models developed for SER, creates the speech mode of BiMER, while the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model used for TER creates the text mode of BiMER. In this way, BiMER was supported with data augmentation methods and the robustness and generalization ability of the model were improved, reaching 88.33% accuracy. Finally, the developed BiMER system was implemented as a real-time web application using the Flask framework, and the capacity of this application to recognize emotions interactively through the user interface was tested.",

        "abstract": "Few-shot learning aims to develop well-trained models by using only a few annotated samples. However, the performance of few-shot learning deteriorates if inappropriate support samples are selected. This happens because of its large dependency on only a few support samples, which limits the stable upgrade of performance even when additional training samples are provided. To overcome this issue, we introduce an active instance selection mechanism where effective support instances are chosen from the unlabeled pool to improve the performance of few-shot classification while maintaining the same annotation cost. Our mechanism comprises four processing steps: feature pre-processing, feature distribution fitting, instance scoring, and instance selection. First, the feature pre-processing normalizes the scattered features to obtain a well-defined distribution stably. Then, the feature distribution fitting finds the distributional relationship between the support images and the unlabeled query samples. Finally, in instance scoring and instance selection, we select the instances based on the instance-wise score estimated by using the fitted distributions. To verify the validity of the proposed mechanism, we employ various algorithms for the feature distribution fitting and the instance scoring. We perform several experiments by integrating the proposed mechanism into a variety of few-shot classification methods. Furthermore, we validate the effectiveness of our mechanism’s components through extensive ablation studies. The experimental results verify that the proposed algorithm presents stable performance improvement with some additional labeling cost for the few-shot classification task. We also present the optimal methods to select effective samples to be labeled for the target few-shot classification algorithms.",

Previous research has shown CEW is an efficient means of electrically inducing motion in a liquid-metal slug, but precise control of the slug’s position within fluidic channels has not been demonstrated. Here, the precise positioning of liquid-metal slugs is achieved using CEW actuation in conjunction with channels designed to minimize the liquid-metal surface energy at discrete locations. This approach leverages the high surface tension of liquid metal to control its resting position with submillimeter accuracy. The CEW actuation and fluidic channel design were optimized to create reconfigurable RF devices. In addition, solutions for the reliable actuation of a gallium-based, non-toxic liquid-metal alloy (Galinstan) are presented that mitigate the tendency of the alloy to form a surface oxide layer capable of wetting to the channel walls, inhibiting motion. A reconfigurable slot antenna utilizing these techniques to achieve a 15.2% tunable frequency bandwidth is demonstrated.",

To enhance this shopping experience, the supply chain also offers buy-online-and-pick-up-in-store (BOPS) services. A model was constructed considering the cost-sharing of customer experience investment to improve the performance level of the omnichannel supply chain. The analysis examined the optimal choice of unified pricing or differential pricing for online and offline channels using the Stackelberg game model. The results show that implementation of a cost-sharing cooperation contract can increase customer experience investment and consumer demand and improve supply chain performance. Specifically, the pricing strategy was associated with channel competition and the customer experience factor. The unified pricing strategy performed better when competition intensity was lower, and the differential pricing strategy performed better when competition intensity was higher. Therefore, in the omnichannel supply chain, excessive channel competition should be avoided, and cooperative investment in the customer experience among supply chain actors should be encouraged. This study is novel as it considers customer experience investment level as an endogenous variable, in contrast with previous studies.",

However, high-fidelity simulation model building depends on accurate data. In particular, first-principles models are desirable source information for simulations, but such models generally are not available at an early design stage. This paper investigates the automatic generation of first-principles 3-D models for piping intensive systems based on design information that is available at an early design stage, namely piping & instrumentation diagrams (P&ID). An algorithm is presented for the generation of such 3-D models based on machine-readable P&ID information.

The JPEG Snack file comprises two components: i) a default JPEG-1 image and ii) an ISO base media file format (ISOMBFF (ISO/IEC 14496-12)) box-based file extension. The JPEG-1 image portion makes the file compatible with existing JPEG viewers for preview and user navigation, while enhanced JPEG Snack viewers can display the rich image/audio/video/caption short-form content. The article presents essential features of the JPEG Snack and its comparison with JPEG-linked media format (JLINK (ISO/IEC 19566-7)) and JPEG 360 (ISO/IEC 19566-6). It also presents the pros and cons of JPEG Snack over high-efficiency image file format (HEIF (ISO/IEC 23008-12)).",
