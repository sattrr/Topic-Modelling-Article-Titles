The main challenges for the designing of mobile terminal antennas are to meet the compact size requirements of built-in structures and their multiband capabilities. The antenna design techniques that are used to achieve broader operating bandwidths with smaller antenna dimensions will be first discussed. This is followed by the effects of user interactions with the head/hand for mobile antennas in terms of radiation efficiency and, consequently, the correlation of multiple input multiple output (MIMO) antenna systems. The ultimate aims of this paper are as follows: 1) to highlight the different frequencies of mobile terminal antennas for different applications; 2) to highlight mobile terminal antennas that have been developed for 5G application; 3) to study and discuss the effects of user's hand on 5G mobile terminal antennas; and 4) to discuss the research gap, issues, and challenges in the field of user's effects on mobile terminal antennas for 5G applications. In addition to that, an investigation of the users' hand effects on two MIMO mobile terminal antennas operational in the sub-6-GHz 5G band is presented.

By assembling two grooved LP elements, the crossed tri-port feed radiation structure is formed.

The proposed antenna works in the X-band and is fed by a parallel plate waveguide power divider. The designed phase gradient metasurface is coplanar with the feeding structure and couples guided waves in the parallel plate waveguide power divider to radiation waves. According to the generalized reflection law, the proposed metasurface is a frequency scanning antenna and the beam direction can be steered slightly from 16.6° to 13°.

        "article": "A dual linearly polarized antenna array with end-fire radiation of the 60-GHz band is proposed by combining two types of magneto-electric dipoles (ME-dipole), which operate in vertical polarization (V-pol) and horizontal polarization (H-pol), respectively. Based on the substrate integrated waveguide structure, two kinds of ME-dipole are placed closely by sharing the same metallic post wall between them, achieving an element space of 0.77λ0. Besides, mutual coupling between the close elements is numerically analyzed and then suppressed by making modifications to the antenna structure. The proposed dual-polarized element achieves bandwidths of 26% and 32% (|S11| <; -14 dB) for the V-pol and H-pol, respectively. A 1×8 element array is designed, fabricated, and measured. Good agreement is achieved between the measurement and simulation. For the V-pol excitation, a bandwidth of 21% is obtained and gain is up to 16.1 dB. For the H-pol excitation, the bandwidth is 18% and peak gain is 15.1 dB. Radiation patterns are stable over the operating frequencies with cross polarizations below -30 dB for both polarizations. The port isolation is very high above 45 dB. With all these advantages of dual polarization, end-fire radiation, stable gain, and high port isolation, the proposed array is a potential candidate for the future 5G applications.",

        "article": "This paper consists of two parts. The first part presents a review of the recent development in broadband circularly polarized filtering antennas. The second part presents a novel design of broadband integrated filtering antenna based on eighth-mode SIW (EMSIW) resonators for rectenna applications. This work has three main novel contributions. First, by adjusting the external quality factors and coupling coefficients of the resonators in this filtering antenna, optimum input impedance with a complex value can be realized within the filtering antenna. Thus there is no need for an external impedance matching network, which is usually required between the antenna and the rectifying circuits; Second, compared with traditional microstrip resonators, high-Q EMSIW cavities are used to increase antenna gain; third, the coupling gap between the EMSIW resonators also acts as the feeding structure of the radiator. So the feeding structures are all on the middle layer. The ground plane on the back side is a complete structure without any defects. This novel structure design improves front-to-back ratio to enhance the antenna receiving efficiency. To validate this method, two C-band circularly polarized integrated filtering antennas with an input impedance of 50 Ω and complex impedance are designed, simulated, and fabricated. The measured results show that the operating frequency bandwidth of the proposed antennas is more than 14.5% at C-band with the gain above 8 dBi. The 3-dB axial ratio bandwidth is larger than 8.5% and the front-to-back ratio is higher than 18 dB. Moreover, the proposed antenna with complex impedance is conjugate matched with the input impedance of a specific rectifying circuit at 5.8 GHz and harmonics suppression at the second-harmonic frequency is achieved.",

Each metasurface antenna consists of a cavity milled from aluminum stock, with an upper plate patterned with a set of radiating slots. As a function of frequency, the metasurface cavities produce a set of spatially diverse radiation patterns that probe the reflectivity distribution of a scene. The antennas are designed to maximize the measurement diversity and hence imaging capacity of the system. The number and distribution of the radiating slots is optimized by balancing the cavity quality factor (Q) and Fourier space coverage. In the experimental realizations, the radiation patterns from each cavity-fed metasurface antenna is first measured using near-field scanning techniques, propagated over the imaging domain, and then stored for use in the image reconstruction step. Comprehensive alignment procedure is implemented to align the measured radiation patterns with regard to the physical position of the cavities. Using a modeling platform, we find excellent agreement between the simulation and experiment, indicating the validity of the calibration and alignment procedures. The scaling of the cavity-fed metasurface antenna represents a key step in the development of alternative high-frequency apertures for imaging and beam-forming applications.",

In addition, compared with the previously reported work, the PCM-based CP antenna exhibits a larger 3-dB AR beam width of 200° in the xoz plane and 120° in the yoz plane, and a wider CP bandwidth within the operational bandwidth.
