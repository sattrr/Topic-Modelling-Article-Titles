In the proposed scheme, a random noise is purposely introduced to distort customers' power consumption data at the smart meter so that data recovery becomes infeasible. Using the power consumption data and prior knowledge about added random noise, we develop an efficient algorithm for power consumption distribution reconstruction needed for power demand analysis and prediction. As a complete solution, our scheme also supports a privacy-preserving billing service. Using experimental results from real world single household power consumption data set and synthesized data of a large number of households, we demonstrate that the proposed scheme is robust against known attacks. Since it does not demand new facilities on existing smart grids, the proposed scheme offers a practical solution.",

The effective relative permittivities are calculated utilizing the time-domain finite integration technique. The effective permittivity of disordered mixtures deviates from established mixing theories especially in cases of high permittivity contrast between inclusions and matrix material, and is strongly correlated to the cross-sectional area of the inclusion crystals. Electric energy density localizes at the edges and corners of inclusions in a manner independent of inclusion shape and influenced by EM propagation direction and surrounding inclusions. For mixtures with both disordered irregular and more organized cube inclusions, energy localization increases as the EM signal travels through the mixture before decreasing due to attenuation of the propagating EM signal.

We first investigate the specific attributes of private data based on the search engine (Google) in different application scenarios, such as the data importance and dependence. Based on these attributes, private data are divided into four security domains in a given application scenario, which is further protected by applying different protection policies.

        "article": "In the international guidelines/standards for human protection, the specific absorption rate (SAR) is used as a metric to prevent excessive surface temperature elevation at frequencies up to 3 or 10 GHz. Above that transition frequency, including the frequency region assigned to 5th generation wireless communication systems, an area-averaged incident power density on human body surface is used as the physical quantity to specify the restrictions on human exposure to electromagnetic fields. However, the incident power density is an external physical quantity, resulting in frequency-dependent temperature elevation, which is attributable to frequency-dependent variations in the reflection coefficient at the skin surface and energy penetration depth into tissue. In this paper, we discuss analytically and computationally the effectiveness of the transmitted power density (TPD) at the skin as a new metric to estimate the steady-state skin temperature elevation above the transition frequency. We also consider simplified models for uniform and Gaussian beam patterns and the analytical solutions to the bioheat equation for an one-dimensional model, which are in good agreement with numerical solutions. These show that the TPD provides an excellent estimate of skin temperature elevation through the millimetre-wave band (30-300 GHz) and a reasonable and conservative estimate down to 10 GHz, whereas the SAR is a good metric below 3 GHz. Computational results for the dipole and patch antenna arrays demonstrated that the one-dimensional analysis is conservative metric as compared with the TPD averaged over the area of 4 cm2 (2-cm square). Considering extreme cases, averaging area smaller than 4 cm2 is needed above 30 GHz for beam exposure with small diameters. Finally, we consider the choice of averaging area as related to peak temperature increases for small beams. For extremely small exposure areas, limits on peak power density may be needed.",

At first, we propose a fully homomorphic non-interactive verifiable secret sharing (FHNVSS) scheme. In this scheme, shareholders can generate shares of any-degree polynomials of shared numbers without interaction, and the dealer can verify the correctness of shares sent by shareholders without interaction. We implemented the FHNVSS scheme in Python with a detailed performance evaluation. According to our tests, the performance of FHNVSS is satisfactory. For instance, when the request is a 10-degree polynomial of secret value, generating a response takes about 0.0017263 s; verifying a response takes about 0.1221394 s; recovering a result takes about 0.0003862 s. Besides, we make an extension on the FHNVSS scheme to obtain a fully non-interactive secure multi-party computation, called AntNest. In the AntNest scheme, distrustful parties can jointly calculate a any-degree negotiated function, the inputs of which are inputs of all parties, without interaction, and each party can verify the correctness of responses sent by parties without interaction.

        "abstract": "In this paper, we focus on the research of non-interactive secure multi-party computation. At first, we propose a fully homomorphic non-interactive verifiable secret sharing (FHNVSS) scheme. In this scheme, shareholders can generate shares of any-degree polynomials of shared numbers without interaction, and the dealer can verify the correctness of shares sent by shareholders without interaction. We implemented the FHNVSS scheme in Python with a detailed performance evaluation. According to our tests, the performance of FHNVSS is satisfactory. For instance, when the request is a 10-degree polynomial of secret value, generating a response takes about 0.0017263 s; verifying a response takes about 0.1221394 s; recovering a result takes about 0.0003862 s. Besides, we make an extension on the FHNVSS scheme to obtain a fully non-interactive secure multi-party computation, called AntNest. In the AntNest scheme, distrustful parties can jointly calculate a any-degree negotiated function, the inputs of which are inputs of all parties, without interaction, and each party can verify the correctness of responses sent by parties without interaction. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first work to realize that parties can jointly calculate any-degree function, the inputs of which are inputs of all parties, without interaction.",

Studies have shown that it has attracted great attention in the field of healthcare. However, research studies show a number of healthcare consumers are yet to accept the technology, especially in developing countries due to reasons, such as the data security and the improper utilization of available information and communication technologies (ICTs) in healthcare. This paper therefore aims to identify factors affecting healthcare consumers' attitude toward the adoption of the cloud-based health center. Questionnaires were administered to 465 respondents in four locations in Benue, Nigeria with 76.9% response rate. The analysis of the data was conducted with statistical package for social science (20.0), factor analysis, and LISREL (9.30), was used to determine the structural path model. Using the social technical design approach, we developed the cloud-based health center which will provide access to healthcare services remotely to rural communities and reduce the cost/time of medical healthcare delivery when implemented into the Nigerian healthcare system. The results show that performance expectancy (β = 0.31 and t = 5.80), effort expectancy (β = 0.19 and t = 3.90), social influence (β = 0.21 and t = 3.95), facilitating conditions (β = 0.22 and t = 4.82), data security (β = 0.15 and t = 3.07), and information sharing (β = 0.11 and t = 2.53) had a significant impact on the behavioral intention of healthcare consumers. However, cloud-based health knowledge (β = 0.09 and t = 1.49) was found to be statistically not significant.

The challenge here is finding the best tradeoff between the VM migration optimization performance and complexity. On one hand, to improve the migration efficiency, VM migration planning is adopted to achieve efficient resource reuse while minimizing the number of VM migrations. On the other hand, the huge number of PMs and VMs in a cloud datacenter often adds considerable complexity to migration planning, which hampers the decision-making process in VM migration. To address these issues, this paper proposes a hybrid resource pool model to reduce the complexity of VM migration planning by limiting the scope of VM migration decisions. Then, based on this model, we use our novel resource-reuse optimization mechanism (called HirePool) to improve efficiency by maximizing resource usage with only a few VM migrations. Finally, we perform simulation tests and actual experiments running on a real cloud platform to evaluate HirePool. Results show that HirePool improves average resource usage by 13%, saves the number of PMs used by 12%, and reduces the average number of migrations (compared with contrast mechanisms) by 31%.",

The multiple plasmon resonances, cross-polarization rotation, reflection phase cancellation, and coding sequence principles are combined together to design the presented reflectors. First, an anisotropic unit cell consisting of a two E-shaped metallic resonators on the top side of a PEC-backed dielectric substrate is precisely designed and optimized. The unit cell operates in a linear cross-polarization scheme from about 86 GHz to 94 GHz and has multiple plasmon resonances at 86.5 GHz, 89.2 GHz, 92.2 GHz, and 93.2 GHz with 100% cross-polarization conversion efficiency at these frequencies. Then this unit cell and its mirrored unit cell are used to compose a number of 1-bit coding reflective engineered reflectors to generate the “1”and “0”elements of the coding sequence required for EM-wave shaping. Four engineered reflectors of various coding sequences are designed to shape the backscattered energy to achieve one lobe, two lobes, three lobes, and four lobes. Furthermore, the low-scattering diffuse reflection pattern is also achieved under both normal and oblique incidence by using a random distribution (random coding sequence) of the unit cells across the engineered reflector aperture. Both 3D full wave simulations and measurement results verify the capability of the presented surfaces in shaping the backscattered EM-wave.",

The unit cell operates in a linear cross-polarization scheme from about 86 GHz to 94 GHz and has multiple plasmon resonances at 86.5 GHz, 89.2 GHz, 92.2 GHz, and 93.2 GHz with 100% cross-polarization conversion efficiency at these frequencies. Then this unit cell and its mirrored unit cell are used to compose a number of 1-bit coding reflective engineered reflectors to generate the “1”and “0”elements of the coding sequence required for EM-wave shaping. Four engineered reflectors of various coding sequences are designed to shape the backscattered energy to achieve one lobe, two lobes, three lobes, and four lobes. Furthermore, the low-scattering diffuse reflection pattern is also achieved under both normal and oblique incidence by using a random distribution (random coding sequence) of the unit cells across the engineered reflector aperture. Both 3D full wave simulations and measurement results verify the capability of the presented surfaces in shaping the backscattered EM-wave.",

        "article": "We propose underwater delay-tolerant routing via probabilistic spraying (UDTN-Prob), a routing protocol for underwater delay-tolerant networks based on the store-and-forward paradigm. Our protocol exploits limited statistical knowledge of the time between two subsequent contacts between pairs of network nodes in order to filter the packets injected into the network, so that only those with a sufficiently high chance of being delivered to their intended destination within a given deadline are actually transmitted. In addition, the foreseen duration of a contact is estimated via a preliminary packet exchange, so that the nodes get a fair share of the contact time to exchange their own data. The transmission is protected against channel-induced packet losses via an automatic repeat query scheme modified to adapt itself to typical underwater transmission times and to the variation of round-trip times induced by node mobility.

        "abstract": "We propose underwater delay-tolerant routing via probabilistic spraying (UDTN-Prob), a routing protocol for underwater delay-tolerant networks based on the store-and-forward paradigm. Our protocol exploits limited statistical knowledge of the time between two subsequent contacts between pairs of network nodes in order to filter the packets injected into the network, so that only those with a sufficiently high chance of being delivered to their intended destination within a given deadline are actually transmitted. In addition, the foreseen duration of a contact is estimated via a preliminary packet exchange, so that the nodes get a fair share of the contact time to exchange their own data. The transmission is protected against channel-induced packet losses via an automatic repeat query scheme modified to adapt itself to typical underwater transmission times and to the variation of round-trip times induced by node mobility. We simulate the protocol using the DESERT Underwater libraries, that make it possible to accurately reproduce the nodes' behavior and mobility patterns. Our results show that the proposed protocol achieves significantly better performance than spray-and-wait, which is currently the most typical choice among store-and-forward protocols.

Then, a prototype is implemented to validate the proposed methods. Experimental results have shown that both the methods can be used to achieve maximum output power during the movement of power pickups.

It is crucial to propose the fault-tolerant and energy-efficient evolution models to accomplish tasks of applications in these environments. Previous studies have reported that scale-free (SF) topologies can improve the fault-tolerance of WSNs. However, energy-efficiency is less concerned in most of these SF WSNs models. In addition, previous models took only node degree into account in calculating connection probabilities between two nodes, topological characteristics, which can enhance reliable communication, are rarely considered. To address these shortcomings, we present three new SF-evolution mechanisms (ECN, ELP, and ELCP) of large-scale WSNs from the novel aspect of link prediction. Specifically, three well-known link prediction methods, which are topology concerned, named common neighbors (CN), local path (LP), and local community paradigm (LCP) are adopted in the corresponding models to enhance energy-efficiency of SF-WSNs. Meanwhile, residual energy and degree capacity are taken into consideration in the proposed models to balance the node energy consumption. We also explore the degree distribution of networks generated by our models and present the theoretical derivation of it. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed models can generate SF-WSNs topologies with better fault-tolerance and higher energy-efficiency by comparing with a candidate clustering-based algorithm and other two SF enhancing algorithms. Moreover, ELCP’s performance is the best among the three models, followed by ELP and ECN.",

Specifically, three well-known link prediction methods, which are topology concerned, named common neighbors (CN), local path (LP), and local community paradigm (LCP) are adopted in the corresponding models to enhance energy-efficiency of SF-WSNs. Meanwhile, residual energy and degree capacity are taken into consideration in the proposed models to balance the node energy consumption. We also explore the degree distribution of networks generated by our models and present the theoretical derivation of it. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed models can generate SF-WSNs topologies with better fault-tolerance and higher energy-efficiency by comparing with a candidate clustering-based algorithm and other two SF enhancing algorithms. Moreover, ELCP’s performance is the best among the three models, followed by ELP and ECN.",

Compared with the conventional control method, when operating under high wind speeds, the newly designed SMC strategy of DFIGs is capable of producing a faster response time, a higher mechanical energy extraction percentage, and a better power quality.

Furthermore, the impact of energy harvesting duration on the DMT performance has been extensively investigated. Consequently, it is observed that the achievable diversity gain of the EH-DDF improves with the reduction in energy harvesting interval. However, there exists a performance difference between the classical non-EH-based DDF and EHDDF even for the minute harvest duration.

Although massive MIMO is suitable for inter-base station (BS) wireless backhaul networks, how to adequately assign each BS's antennas remains unsolved. In this paper, a distributed mechanism termed hierarchical distributed adjustment is proposed. On the basis of the links' channel conditions, BSs' available antennas, users' service requirements, and neighbors' allocation decisions, the transceiving antennas of each link are adjusted to both fulfill the quality-of-service constraints and maximize the total utility of the best-effort traffic. Through analysis, we prove that this problem is nondeterministic polynomial-complete, and the performance gap between the proposed heuristic and the optimal solution is bounded.

Toward precise bionano sensing techniques in the brain, we investigate the challenges of modeling spatial distribution of astrocyte networks by developing a mathematical framework that lays the groundwork for future early detection techniques of the neurodegenerative disease. In this paper, we investigate the effect of the β-amyloid plaques in astrocytes with Alzheimer's disease. We developed a computation model of healthy and Alzheimer's diseases astrocytes networks from the state-of-the-art models and results that account for the intracellular pathways, IP3 dynamics, gap junctions, voltage-gated calcium channels, and astrocytes volumes. We also implemented different types of astrocytes network topologies, including shortcut networks, regular degree networks, Erdös Rényi networks, and link radius networks. A proposed multi-scale stochastic computational model captures the relationship between the intracellular and intercellular scales. Finally, we designed and evaluated a singlehop communication system with frequency modulation using metrics such as propagation extend, molecular delay, and channel gain. The results show that the more unstable but at the same time lower level oscillations of Alzheimer's astrocyte networks can create a multi-scale effect on communication between astrocytes with increased molecular delay and lower channel gain compared to healthy astrocytes, with an elevated impact on Erdös Rényi network and link radius network topologies.",

Each microgrid includes multiple renewable power suppliers (RPSs), which directly compete with each other to be the sole supplier of the node. The operator needs to specify the energy storage level for each RPS along the backhaul and the wireless service price for the end users. Then, the RPSs will determine their individual energy prices. The problem is formulated as a Stackelberg game between the leader (the wireless operator) and multiple followers (RPSs). We will identify the RPSs' unique equilibrium pricing scheme as well as the operator's optimal energy storage and wireless service price decisions. Our analysis also provides the important observation that direct competition between RPSs on the same backhaul node will induce the operator to store more energy and can thus improve the revenues of both the operator and the RPSs. Furthermore, we consider that RPSs along the backhaul may form coalitions to better coordinate their pricing decisions when they sell energy to the wireless operator. Such a study leads to a hybrid twolevel game whose the first level is similar to the Stackelberg game for the non-cooperative scenario. We will show that a coalition formation depends crucially on how the wireless traffic will be affected by the energy price reduction due to the coalition formation. In a nutshell, the proposed techniques provide insights for operating a green cellular backhaul by using the distribute energy sources in a decentralized market setting. Finally, simulation results are presented to compare the solutions of the competitive model with those of the cooperative model.

        "article": "This paper focuses on the problem of interoperability and resource sharing in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) running under the Internet of Things (IoT) and cyber-physical systems (CPSs). Considering the scale of IoT/CPS projects, conventional WSN virtualization techniques remain incapable because of the hardware/software constraints and heterogeneity. To this end, in this paper, an agent-based server system approach, which improves the resource sharing between heterogeneous WSNs in IoT/CPS providers, is proposed. In line with this approach, a software agent framework is introduced. With the help of the framework, called Firat Virtual WSN framework (FVWSN), the clients can move the commands/queries and data fusion/aggregation algorithms, which use on their local networks, to the provider side and run them remotely or automatically. This process is carried out by logical agent entities, called virtual nodes, which are created with the help of FVWSN. In this way, since the client evaluation mechanism is performed at a closer point to the shared resources, a shorter response time can be achieved in time-critical applications. The most important features that differentiate the developed agent framework from other agent-based technologies are that it is semi-autonomous and uses a specific resource selection/allocation algorithm. With the improvement that FVWSN provides for IoT/CPS WSN providers, it is possible to achieve a shorter response time and allow more client applications to share the same limited WSN resources. In this paper, first, the analysis and the necessity of the proposed system are discussed. Then, the system is simulated in the OPNET Modeler platform to make comparisons with well-known conventional WSN resource sharing mechanisms. Finally, the physical comparison tests of the system are carried out on an OpenStack-based cloud system, and the success of the system is shown.",

Here, we demonstrate how an RF plasma can be delivered through water or air and harvested as a storable DC voltage. In this method, experiments I and II were conducted to prove the feasibilities of transmitting a power as an RF plasma through water and air. In both experiments, the RF plasma was transmitted from an USB/ battery-powered RF plasma source with the help of a monopole antenna, whilst the power in the receiving end was captured using an Avramenko diode configuration and then multiplied using a multi-staged differential voltage multiplier. In both experiments, the results and efficiency of energy harvesting highly depended on the number of multiplication stages in the differential voltage multiplier. In experiment I, the RF power was successfully delivered along the surface of water as a surface wave to light up a neon lamp, with the measured transmission efficiency being stable over almost the whole transmission range. However, the transmission efficiency was weakly dependent upon the water conductivity. In experiment II, the RF power was successfully delivered through air but only over a rather limited transmission range, beyond which the approximate transmission efficiency was found to be inversely proportional to the transmission range. The Overall findings of this paper have opened up the possibility for 1) energizing wearable electronics with an RF plasma; 2) sensing of RF plasmas; and 3) harvesting electric energy of a natural plasma source such as a lightning strike over a wet land or an ocean.",

From this aspect, the borehole system, as an interseasonal heating storage, can effectively utilize renewable energy to provide heating to ease the adverse impact from domestic heating. This paper proposes an optimal charging strategy for borehole thermal storage by harvesting energy from photovoltaic (PV) generation in a low-carbon space heating system. The system optimizes the heat injection generated by air source heat pump in the charging seasons to charge the borehole, which provides high inlet temperature for ground source heat pump to meet space heating demand in discharging seasons. The borehole is modeled by partial differential equations, solved by the finite-element method at both 2D and 3D for volume simulation. The pattern search optimization is used to resolve the model. The case study illustrates that with the optimal charging strategies, less heat flux injection can help the borehole to reach a higher temperature so that the heating system is more efficient compared with boilers. This paper can benefit communities with seasonable borehole storage to provide clean but low-cost heating and also maximize PV penetration.",

To address this issue, strategies from both hardware and software perspectives have been proposed, and yet, the existing hardware methods usually have a high cost. Software strategies mainly focus on the operating system page allocation strategy to maximize resource idleness. The partial array self-refresh technique has been proposed to allow for some of the DRAM cells to retain the self-refresh state while shutting down the others. Using this technique, numerous studies extend the unused DRAM idle time by clustering the applications' data but do not discuss the impact of the address mapping mechanism on power consumption. However, this impact was proven to be essential in our previous study. In this paper, we attempt to investigate the impacts of different memory mapping schemes on different clustering strategies using a hierarchy-based memory management system (HBMM) and provide insights for selecting the optimal schemes. The experimental results on the Android platform demonstrate that the schemes and strategies are closely correlated, and memory idle time can be prolonged 125 times with their suitable combination. Conversely, the worst scheme may decrease memory idleness by 12% compared with the original system.

In this paper, we propose an improved NCMA (I-NCMA) for non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) in the 5G wireless communications, consisting of multiple users and a single base station (BS). At the transmitter side, the proposed scheme enables all users to simultaneously transmit messages to the BS in the same time and frequency. At the receiver side, we propose a joint-user channel decoding (JU-CD) to jointly decode all user messages by a single decoder. Then, the extrinsic messages from JU-CD can be jointly utilized by MUDCD for decoding all user messages. Also, other than conventional NCMA that mainly deals with two users, I-NCMA adapts to the NOMA networks with an arbitrary number of users. Simulation results indicate that the proposed I-NCMA achieves a better decoding performance than both SIC and conventional NCMA over near power-balanced channels in the low-to-medium SNR regime, while retaining a performance close to conventional NCMA in the high SNR regime.",

Selected TSN mechanisms offer the possibility to emulate the well-known traffic classes found in mixed-criticality distributed systems: Time-triggered (TT) communication with low jitter and bounded endto-end latency, audio-video-bridging (AVB) streams with bounded end-to-end latency, and general besteffort messages, which have no timing guarantees. Critical traffic is guaranteed via the global network schedule which is stored in so-called gate control lists (GCLs) and controls the timely behavior of frames for each queue of an egress port. Although researchers have started to propose approaches for the routing and scheduling (i.e., GCL synthesis) of TT traffic, all previous research has ignored lower priority realtime traffic, such as AVB, resulting in TT configurations that may increase the worst-case delays of AVB traffic, rendering it unschedulable.

        "abstract": "IEEE 802.1 time-sensitive networking (TSN) is a set of amendments to the IEEE 802.1 standard that enable safety-critical and real-time behavior over Ethernet for the industrial automation and automotive domains. Selected TSN mechanisms offer the possibility to emulate the well-known traffic classes found in mixed-criticality distributed systems: Time-triggered (TT) communication with low jitter and bounded endto-end latency, audio-video-bridging (AVB) streams with bounded end-to-end latency, and general besteffort messages, which have no timing guarantees. Critical traffic is guaranteed via the global network schedule which is stored in so-called gate control lists (GCLs) and controls the timely behavior of frames for each queue of an egress port. Although researchers have started to propose approaches for the routing and scheduling (i.e., GCL synthesis) of TT traffic, all previous research has ignored lower priority realtime traffic, such as AVB, resulting in TT configurations that may increase the worst-case delays of AVB traffic, rendering it unschedulable. In this paper, we propose a joint routing and scheduling approach for TT traffic, which takes into account the AVB traffic, such that both TT and the AVB traffic are schedulable. We extensively evaluate our approach on a number of synthetic and realistic test cases.",

According to the main targeted objective, the current RA techniques are classified into three categories: massive access control techniques, energy efficiency techniques, and performance improvement techniques.

The joint time duration and power allocation optimization problems for both AF and DF relay-assisted WPCNs are investigated to maximize the energy efficiency of HRN, which are challenging to solve due to the nonconvexity and strong coupling of variables. For the DF relay-assisted WPCN, we propose an optimal time duration and power allocation algorithm by decomposing the original problem into three subproblems, i.e., time duration allocation subproblem for users' information transfer, time duration allocation subproblem for HRN's energy and information transfer, and HRN's power allocation subproblem. For the AF rely-assisted WPCN, we propose an iterative algorithm to optimize the transmit power and energy transfer time of HRN, by proving the quasi-concavity of the objective function where the optimal time duration allocation has been derived. The simulation results verify that the proposed algorithms can render significant energy efficiency gains, e.g., the performance gains of the proposed algorithms are about 300% and 150% compared with the existing schemes for the AF relay-assisted WPCN and DF relay-assisted WPCN, respectively, when the noise power is relatively large.",

In this paper, we present a new scheme to quickly and accurately construct a vessel safety navigation depth reference map, which contains appropriate channel water depth information. This effective scheme is based on automated identification system (AIS) data and increases the travel safety through crowded waterways. AIS data include rich maritime traffic information.

In particular, from a demography perspective, Facebook shows the lowest growth pattern among adolescents. Gender-based analysis showed that growth among men is still higher than the growth in women. Our geographical analysis reveals that while Facebook growth is slower in western countries, it has the fastest growth in the developing countries mainly located in Africa and Central Asia; analyzing the penetration of these countries also shows that these countries are at earlier stages of Facebook penetration.

To analyze the impact of these techniques, we introduce mathematical sectored antenna models that are deduced from mmWave antenna radiation patterns.

The main contribution of our work is the consideration of channel inversion, which is more realistic than the commonly used transmit model.

The objective of this paper is to analyze the SINR and the energy efficiency of outband D2D links for UEs equipped with directional mmWave antennas. To do so, we implement an energy efficiency calculation that considers both directional antennas and channel inversion.

Several challenges associated with WSNs have been researched and energy consumption represents the main limitation. Another major challenge is localization because a sensor or node should be self-contained and organized and have a low cost of integration. The range-free approach is promising due to its simplicity. Notably, it does not require additional logics and needs only key parameters, such as the number of hops and node locations. Distance-vector-hop-based localization (DV-Hop) is a pioneering range-free approach, and the corresponding localization approximation method does not require areas to be covered by nodes with known positions (also called known nodes or anchor nodes). However, the precision of this approach relies on several factors, including the node density and the method of determining the relation between the distance and the number of hops between two anchor nodes (i.e., hop size). Thus, this research enhances DV-Hop by: 1) reducing the approximation coverage to a specific area, thereby requiring fewer anchor nodes; 2) further decreasing the area using a bounding box; and 3) adopting particle swarm optimization (PSO) by integrating the number of hops and anchor nodes into the fitness function to improve the approximation precision. To evaluate the efficiency of the proposed scheme, the simulation results are compared with those of five recently proposed DV-Hop localization methods: iDV-Hop, DV-maxHop, Selective 3-Anchor DV-Hop, PSODV-Hop, and GA-PSODV-Hop.",

        "article": "The increasing concern in environmental impacts contributed by the shipping industry leads to a growing interest toward incorporating sustainable energy sources to conventional power systems, to reduce fuel consumption and emissions. However, such advance power system architectures tend to face greater challenges in optimal power allocation due to the increased flexibility to split the load among multiple power sources and diversified operations of different vessel types. To address the power management challenges, in this paper, an instantaneous optimization-based approach is proposed for an all-electric hybrid power system, which adopts the equivalent consumption minimization strategy (ECMS). First, the dynamic models of the all-electric hybrid power system are formulated in MATLAB∖Simulink and validated on a laboratory-scaled hybrid power system testbed.

        "abstract": "The increasing concern in environmental impacts contributed by the shipping industry leads to a growing interest toward incorporating sustainable energy sources to conventional power systems, to reduce fuel consumption and emissions. However, such advance power system architectures tend to face greater challenges in optimal power allocation due to the increased flexibility to split the load among multiple power sources and diversified operations of different vessel types. To address the power management challenges, in this paper, an instantaneous optimization-based approach is proposed for an all-electric hybrid power system, which adopts the equivalent consumption minimization strategy (ECMS). First, the dynamic models of the all-electric hybrid power system are formulated in MATLAB∖Simulink and validated on a laboratory-scaled hybrid power system testbed. The power management problem is then formulated using ECMS approach, and a multi-level power management framework is proposed to integrate ECMS solution for practical implementation on an all-electric hybrid vessel.

        "article": "With the development of wireless communication techniques, higher spectrum efficiency is being pursued for the fifth generation (5G) mobile communication. Cognitive radio (CR) has attracted much attention from industry and academia due to its ability to improve spectrum efficiency. In 5G CR networks, the most important function is spectrum sensing (SS). However, SS performance deteriorates seriously for single-antenna signal detection. To improve spectrum efficiency, multiple-antenna (MA) signal-detection techniques have been proposed to improve SS performance by taking advantage of MA diversity reception. In this paper, we propose an MGF-based method for performance analysis of SS over k - μ channels for 5G CR networks. The expressions of the average detection probabilities are derived in closed form for cases of SA signal detection and MA signal detection. For MA signal detection, we mainly consider maximal ratio combining (MRC) and square law combining (SLC) diversity reception scheme over the k - μ fading channel. The improvement in detection performance is quantified for the MRC and SLC schemes. The simulation results show that the MRC and SLC diversity reception (L > 1) schemes achieve significant sensing diversity gains compared with that in the SA case.",

Similarly to radio-based data broadcasting systems, such as Wi-Fi, VLC opens the possibilities of hiding information in the public channel.

This VLC system utilizes pulse position modulation and direct sequence-code division multiple access modulation. In our implementation, multiple steganographic data streams are mixed with the spreading codes and combined with the overt data stream. We achieve a steganographic transmission rate of approximately 1 Mb/s hidden in a 110-Mb/s data stream.

The fixed users are allowed to share access to this spectrum with some mobile users in their proximity in exchange for cooperative relaying. We consider a practical scenario, where only partial channel state information (CSI) is available at the users' transmitters, and we propose a robust algorithm against such uncertainties in CSI values. We also propose a reputation-based relay selection mechanism to identify selfish portable users.

A robust mechanism of authentication and secure communication is required to protect privacy and conditional resolution of pseudonyms to revoke malicious vehicles. In a typical ITS framework, a station can be a vehicle, road side unit, or a server that can participate in communication. During authentication, the real identity of an intelligent transport system station, referred to as a vehicle, should not be revealed in order to preserve its privacy. In this paper, we propose a Strong Pseudonym-based AutenTicAtion (SPATA) framework for preserving the real identity of vehicles. The distributed architecture of SPATA allows vehicles to generate pseudonyms in a very private and secure way. In the absence of a distributed architecture, the privacy cannot be preserved by storing information regarding vehicles in a single location. Therefore, the concept of linkability of certificates based on single authority is eliminated. This is done by keeping the real identity to pseudonym mappings distributed. Furthermore, the size of the certificate revocation list (CRL) is kept small, as only the most recent revoked communication pseudonyms are kept in the CRL. The privacy of the vehicle is preserved during the revocation and resolution phase through the distributed mechanism. Empirical results show that SPATA is a lightweight framework with low computational overhead, average latency, overhead ratio, and stable delivery ratio in both sparse and dense network scenarios.",

In this paper, we propose novel relay selection policies aiming at reducing the average delay by incorporating the buffer size of the relays into the decision making of the relay selection process. More specifically, we first propose two new delay-aware policies. One is based on the hybrid relay selection algorithm, where the relay selection takes into account the queue sizes so that the delay is reduced and the diversity is maintained. The other approach is based on the max - link relay selection algorithm. For the max - link algorithm, a delay-aware only approach starves the buffers and increases the outage probability of the system. Thus, for max - link, we propose a delay- and diversity-aware BA relay selection policy targeting the reduction of the average delay, while maintaining the diversity of the transmission. The proposed policies are analyzed by means of Markov Chains and expressions for the outage, throughput, and delay are derived. The asymptotic performance of the policies is also discussed.

Recent research efforts in this direction have proposed shard-based consensus protocols where the key idea is to split the transactions among multiple committees (or shards), which then process these shards or set of transactions in parallel. Such a parallel processing of disjoint sets of transactions or shards by multiple committees significantly improves the overall scalability and transaction throughout of the system. However, one significant research gap is a lack of understanding of the strategic behavior of rational processors within committees in such shard-based consensus protocols. Such an understanding is critical for designing appropriate incentives that willfoster cooperation within committees and prevent free-riding. In this paper, we address this research gap by analyzing the behavior of processors using a game-theoretic model, where each processor aims at maximizing its reward at a minimum cost of participating in the protocol. We first analyze the Nash equilibria in an N-player static game model of the sharding protocol. We show that depending on the reward sharing approach employed, processors can potentially increase their payoff by unilaterally behaving in a defective fashion, thus resulting in a social dilemma. In order to overcome this social dilemma, we propose a novel incentive-compatible reward sharing mechanism to promote cooperation among processors. Our numerical results show that achieving a majority of cooperating processors (required to ensure a healthy state of the blockchain network) is easier to achieve with the proposed incentive-compatible reward sharing mechanism than with other reward sharing mechanisms.",
